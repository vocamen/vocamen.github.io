## Why 
### Vision Statement
> Reaching people on screens with Christ's love

This is based on Matt28 Mission:
> Jesus, undeterred, went right ahead and gave his charge: 
> “God authorized and commanded me to commission you: 
> Go out and train everyone you meet, far and near, in this way of life, marking them by
> baptism in the threefold name: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 
> Then instruct them in the practice of all I have commanded you. I’ll be with you as you do > this, day after day after day, right up to the end of the age.” - The Message
and this is our [mission](#mission)
