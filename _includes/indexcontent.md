## Quarantine UPDATE:Video Conference: ok.vocamen.com, Juin 2020
During this time of lock down in France, we deployed a video conference platform to listen and share with anxious and isolated people. 

Durant ce temps de confinement en France, nous avons déployé une plateforme de viso pour écouter et partager avec les gens anxieux et isolés.

## Why 
### Vision Statement
> To reach people with Christ's love through screens

This is based on Matt.28 Commission:
> Jesus, undeterred, went right ahead and gave his charge: 
> “God authorized and commanded me to commission you: 
> Go out and train everyone you meet, far and near, in this way of life, marking them by
> baptism in the threefold name: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 
> Then instruct them in the practice of all I have commanded you. I’ll be with you as you do > this, day after day after day, right up to the end of the age.” - The Message
and this is our [mission](#mission)
