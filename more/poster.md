![first meeting poster](../../img/affiche_rencontre.jpg)

This is the poster we made for our first official meeting.

It expresses how through a treasure hunt game, following dots of the path on a map, we reach the goal indicated by a cross. The cross on the map is the shadow of the cross we barely see in the sky.

Because the real goal is not here on the earth map, it's in heaven.
And a simple game can help reach it.

We made a tutorial video how to create this poster using free 3D and 2D tools, it is available for our supporters on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/vocamen), feel free to join us, it starts at $1.
