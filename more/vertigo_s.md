POLICEMAN: Give me your hand!


POLICEMAN: What's the matter with you? Give me
your hand!


SCOTTIE: Ow!!


MIDGE(Paying little: attention)
I thought you said no more aches and
pains?


SCOTTIE: It's this darned corset. It binds.
He retrieves the stick.


MIDGE: No three-way stretch? How very un-
chic.


SCOTTIE: Well, you know those police department
doctors: no sense of style.


SCOTTIE(Sighs gratefully): Ah, tomorrow!


MIDGE: What's tomorrow?


SCOTTIE: Tomorrow... the corset comes off.
And this thing goes out the window.


SCOTTIE(He waves the stick): I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle
my behind... free and unconfined.


SCOTTIE: Midge, do you suppose many men wear
corsets?


MIDGE: More than you think.


SCOTTIE(Interested): How do you know? Personal experience?


MIDGE: Please!


MIDGE(Then, impersonally): And what happens after tomorrow?


SCOTTIE: What do you mean?


MIDGE: What are you going to do? Now that
you've quit the police force?


SCOTTIE(Gently): You sound so disapproving, Midge.


MIDGE: No, it's your life. But you were the
bright young lawyer who decided he
was going to be chief of police some
day.


SCOTTIE(Gently): I had to quit, Midge.


MIDGE: Why?


SCOTTIE: I wake up at night seeing him fall
from the roof... and try to reach
out for him.


MIDGE: It wasn't your fault.


SCOTTIE: I know. Everybody tells me.


MIDGE: Johnny, the doctors explained --


SCOTTIE: I know. I have Acrophobia. What a
disease. A fear of heights. And what
a moment to find out I had it.


MIDGE: Well, you've got it. And there's no
losing it. And there's no one to
blame. So why quit?


SCOTTIE: And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?


MIDGE: It's where you belong.


SCOTTIE(With a grin): Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I
dropped a pencil on the floor and
bent down to pick it up, it could be
disastrous!


MIDGE(Laughs): Ah, Johnny-O...


MIDGE(Finally, as she works): Well?... what'll you do?


SCOTTIE: Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm
a man of independent means. Or fairly
independent.


MIDGE: Mmm. Why don't you go away for a
while?


SCOTTIE(Grins): To forget? Don't be so motherly,
Midge. I'm not going to crack up.


MIDGE: Have you had any dizzy spells this
week?


SCOTTIE: I'm having one now.


SCOTTIE: From that music.


MIDGE: Oh!


SCOTTIE: What's this do-hickey here?


MIDGE: It's a brassiere. You know about
those things. You're a big boy, now.


SCOTTIE: I've never run across one like that.


MIDGE: It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift.
No shoulder straps, no back straps,
but does everything a brassiere should
do. It works on the principle of the
cantilever bridge.


SCOTTIE(Impressed): Uh-huh!


MIDGE: An aircraft engineer down the
peninsula designed it. He worked it
out in his spare time.


SCOTTIE: What a pleasant hobby.


SCOTTIE: How's your love life, Midge?


MIDGE: That's following a train of thought.


SCOTTIE: Well?


MIDGE: Normal.


SCOTTIE: Aren't you ever going to get married?


MIDGE(Lightly): You know there's only one man in the
world for me, Johnny-O.


SCOTTIE: Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged
once though, weren't we?


MIDGE: Three whole weeks.


SCOTTIE: Ah, sweet college days. But you're
the one who blew it. I'm still
available. Available Ferguson. Say,
Midge, do you remember a guy at
college named Gavin Elster?


MIDGE: Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd
would. No.


SCOTTIE: I got a call from him today. Funny.
He dropped out of sight during the
war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I
guess he's back.


SCOTTIE(he fishes out a slip: of paper)
It's a Mission number.


MIDGE: That's Skid Row... isn't it?


SCOTTIE: Could be.


MIDGE: He's probably on the bum and wants
to touch you for the price of a drink.


SCOTTIE: Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a
couple of drinks and tell him my
troubles. But not tonight. If you
won't drink with me, I'll drink alone,
tonight.


MIDGE: Sorry, old man. Work.


SCOTTIE: Midge, what did you mean, there's no
losing it?


MIDGE: What.


SCOTTIE: My... the acrophobia.


MIDGE: I asked my doctor. He said only
another emotional shock could do it,
and probably wouldn't. And you're
not going to go diving off another
rooftop to find out.


SCOTTIE: I think I can lick it.


MIDGE: How?


SCOTTIE: I've got a theory. Look. If I can
get used to heights just a little at
a time... progressively see?


SCOTTIE: Here, I'll show you what I mean.
We'll start with this.


MIDGE: That!?!


SCOTTIE: What do you want me to start with --
the Golden Gate Bridge?


SCOTTIE: Now. I look up, I look down. I look
up, I look down. Nothing to it.


MIDGE(Overlapping): Stop kidding. Wait a minute.


SCOTTIE: Ah, that's my girl! Here?


MIDGE: Step number two.


SCOTTIE: Okay.


SCOTTIE: I look up, I look down. I look up, I
look down. I'm going to go right out
and buy me a nice, tall stepladder.
Here we go.


MIDGE: Easy, now.


SCOTTIE: This is a cinch. I look up, I look
down. I look up --


MIDGE: Johnny!


SCOTTIE(Muttering, his face: tight, his eyes shut)
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --


SCOTTIE: How'd you get into the shipbuilding
business, Gavin?


ELSTER: I married into it.


SCOTTIE: Interesting business.


ELSTER: No, to be honest, I find it dull.


SCOTTIE: You don't have to do it for a living.


ELSTER: No. But one assumes obligations. My
wife's family is all gone; someone
has to look after her interest. Her
father's partner runs the company
yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so
I decided as long as I had to work
at it, I'd come back here. I've always
liked it here.


SCOTTIE: How long have you been back?


ELSTER: Almost a year.


SCOTTIE: And you like it.


ELSTER: San Francisco's changed. The things
a that spell San Francisco to me are
disappearing fast.


SCOTTIE: Like all this.


ELSTER(Nodding): I'd like to have lived here then.
The color and excitement... the
power...  the freedom.


ELSTER: Shouldn't you be sitting down?


SCOTTIE: No, I'm all right.


ELSTER: I was sorry to read about that thing
in the papers.



ELSTER(No answer): And you've quit the force.



ELSTER(No answer)(Scottie nods): A permanent physical disability?



SCOTTIE: No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling
thing. It just means I can't climb
steep stairs or go to high places,
like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark.
But --



SCOTTIE(Shrugs and smiles): -- there are plenty of street-level
bars In this town.



ELSTER: Would you like a drink now?



SCOTTIE: No... no, thanks. A bit early in the
day for spirits.



SCOTTIE(Pause): Well, I guess that about covers
everything, doesn't it? I never
married; I don't see much of the
"old college gang"; I'm a retired
detective -- and you're in the
shipbuilding business.



SCOTTIE(Pause)(Pause): What's on your mind, Gavin?



ELSTER: I asked you to come up here, Scottie,
knowing that you had quit detective
works, but I wondered whether you
would go back on the job -- as a
special favor to me.



ELSTER: I want you to follow my wife.



ELSTER: Not what you think. We're very happily
married.



SCOTTIE: Then?



ELSTER: I'm afraid some harm may come to
her.



SCOTTIE: From whom?



ELSTER: Someone dead.



ELSTER: Scottie, do you believe that someone
out of the past, someone dead, can
enter and take possession of a living
being?



SCOTTIE: No.



ELSTER: If I told you I believe that his
happened to my wife, what would you
say?



SCOTTIE: I'd say you'd better take her to the
nearest psychiatrist, psychologist,
neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain
family doctor. And have him check
you both.



ELSTER(Defeated): Then you're of no use to me. I'm
sorry I wasted your time. Thank you
for coming in, Scottie.



SCOTTIE: I didn't mean to be that rough.



ELSTER: No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And
you're still the hard-headed Scot,
aren't you? Always were. Do you think
I'm making it up?



SCOTTIE: No.



ELSTER: I'm not making it up. I wouldn't
know how. She'll be talking to me
about something, nothing at all, and
suddenly the words fade into silence
and a cloud comes into her eyes and
they go blank... and she is somewhere
else, away from me... someone I don't
know. I call to her and she doesn't
hear. And then with a long sigh she
is back, and looks at me brightly,
and doesn't know she's been away...
can't tell me where... or why...



SCOTTIE: How often does this happen?



ELSTER: More and more in the past few weeks.
And she wanders. God knows where she
wanders. I followed her one day.



SCOTTIE: Where'd she go?



ELSTER: Watched her come out of the apartment,
someone I didn't know... walking in
a different way... holding her head
in a way I didn't know; and get into
her car, and drive out to...



ELSTER(He smiles grimly): Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She
sat on a bench at the edge of the
lake and stared across the water to
the old pillars that stand an the
far shore, the Portals of the Past.
Sat there a long time, not moving...
and I had to leave, to got to the
office. That evening, when I came
home, I asked what she'd done all
day. She said she'd driven to Golden
Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's
all.



SCOTTIE: Well?



ELSTER: The speedometer of her car showed
she had driven 94 miles that day.
Where did she go?



ELSTER(Pause): I have to know, Scottie. Where she
goes and what she does, before I got
involved with doctors.



SCOTTIE: Have you talked to the doctors at
all?



ELSTER: Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know
more before committing her to that
kind of care.



ELSTER(Anxiously): Scottie --



SCOTTIE(Quickly): I can get you a firm of private eyes
to follow her for you. They're
dependable, good boys --



ELSTER(Breaking in): I want you.



SCOTTIE: It's not my line.



ELSTER: Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I
can trust! I'm in a panic about this!



SCOTTIE: How can I see her, to know her?



ELSTER: We're going to an opening at the
opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's
first.  Which is easier?



SCOTTIE: Ernie's.



ELSTER: All right.



ELSTER(Pause): You won't know what to look for at
first, Scottie. Even I, who know her
so well, cannot tell, sometimes,
when the change has begun. She looks
so lovely and normal...



ELSTER'S VOICE: But I realize now that the deep change
began on the first day I brought her
to San Francisco. You know what San
Francisco does to people who have
never seen it before. All of it
happened to Madeleine, but with such
an intensity as to be almost
frightening. She was like a child
came home. Everything about the city
excited her: she had to walk all the
hills, explore the edge of the ocean,
see all the old houses and wander
the old streets: and when she came
upon something unchanged, something
that was as it had been, her delight
was so strong so fiercely possessive!
These things were hers. And yet she
had never been here before. She had
been born and raised in the East. I
liked it at first, of course. I love
this place; I wanted my bride to
love it.  But then it began to make
me uneasy.  Her delight was too
strong; her excitement was too
intense, it never faded; her laugh
was too loud, her eyes sparkled too
brightly; there was something feverish
about the way she embraced the city.
She possessed it.  And then one day
she changed again...  and a great
sigh settled on her, and the cloud
came into her eyes...



ELSTER'S VOICE: I don't know what happened that day:
where she went, what she saw, what
she did. But on that day, the search
was ended. She had found what she
was looking for, she had come home.
And something in the city possessed
her.



SCOTTIE(Nodding in the: direction of the
gallery)
Who is the woman in the portrait?



SCOTTIE: The one where the lady is sitting.



ATTENDANT: Oh, that's Carlotta, sir.



ATTENDANT(At Scottie's reaction): You'll find it in the catalogue:
"Portrait of Carlotta."



MANAGERESS: Yes?



MANAGERESS: Is there something I can do for you?



SCOTTIE: Yes... you run this hotel.



MANAGERESS: Oh, yes!



SCOTTIE: Would you tell me, who has the room
on the second floor in the corner,
that corner?



MANAGERESS(Brightly): Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out
information of that sort. Our clients
are entitled to their privacy, you
know. And I do believe it's against
the law! Of course, I don't think
any of them would mind, really, but
still I would have to know who you
are, and ask --



MANAGERESS: Oh, dear! Has she done something
wrong?



SCOTTIE: Please answer my question.



MANAGERESS: I can't imagine that sweet girl with
that dear face --



SCOTTIE(Urgently): What is her name?



MANAGERESS: Valdes. Miss Valdes.



MANAGERESS(Pause. Then, brightly): It's Spanish, you know.



SCOTTIE(Slowly): Carlotta Valdes?



MANAGERESS: Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't
it?  Foreign. But sweet.



SCOTTIE(Holding in): How long has she had the room?



MANAGERESS: Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the
rent's due tomorrow.



SCOTTIE: Does she sleep here? Ever?



MANAGERESS: No... she only comes to sit. Two or
three times a week. And I never ask
questions, you know. As long as
they're well behaved. I must say
that I've wondered --



SCOTTIE(Cutting her off): When she comes down, don't say that
I've been here.



MANAGERESS(Brightly): Oh, but she hasn't been here today.
Scottie whirls back on her.



SCOTTIE: I saw her come in five minutes. ago.



MANAGERESS: Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all!
I would have seen her, you know.
I've been right here all the time,
putting olive oil on my rubber plant
leaves!



MANAGERESS: And there! There you see? Her key is
on the rack!



SCOTTIE(Heavily): Would you please go and look?



MANAGERESS: In her room? Well, yes, of course if
you ask. But it does seem silly...



MANAGERESS (O.S.)(Brightly): Oh, Mr. Detective! Would you like to
come and look?



SCOTTIE: Her car is gone.



MANAGERESS: What car?



SCOTTIE: Midge, who do you know that's an
authority an San Francisco history?



MIDGE: Now, that's the kind of greeting a
girl likes.  None of this "hello you
look wonderful" stuff. Just a good
straight "who do you know" --



SCOTTIE(breaking in): Well, who? Come on, you know
everybody.



MIDGE: Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.



SCOTTIE: Not that kind of history. The small
stuff! About people you never heard
of!



MIDGE: Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days
of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy
stories? Like who shot who in the
Embarcadero August, 1879?



SCOTTIE: Yeah.



MIDGE: Pop Leibel.



SCOTTIE: Who?



MIDGE: Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop.
What do you want to know?



SCOTTIE: Who shot who in the Embarcadero in
August, 1879.



MIDGE: Wait a minute! You're not a detective
any more. What's going on?



SCOTTIE(Pausing): Do you know him well?



MIDGE: Pop Leibel? Sure.



SCOTTIE: All right, come on. Introduce me.
Where is your hat?



MIDGE(Speeding to the door): I don't need a hat. Johnny, what's
it about?



SCOTTIE: I'll tell you later. Wait a minute!



POP LEIBEL: Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the
Sad Carlotta...



SCOTTIE: What does a big old wooden house on
the corner of Eddy and Gough Street
have to do with her?



POP LEIBEL: It was hers. It was built for her.
Many years ago.



SCOTTIE: By whom?



POP LEIBEL: By... no... the name I do not
remember. A rich man, a powerful
man.  It is not an unusual story.
She came from somewhere small, to
the south of the city... some say
from a mission settlement... young,
yes; very young.  And she was found
singing and dancing in a cabaret by
the man... wait... wait... Ives!
His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took
her and built for her this great
house in the Western Addition... and
there was a child. Yes. This was it.
The child.



POP LEIBEL: And now, fragments, you understand.
I cannot tell you how much time
passed, or how much happiness there
was. But then he threw her away. He
had no other children; his wife had
no children. He kept the child and
threw her away. Men could do that in
those days. They had the power...
and the freedom. And she became the
Sad Carlotta. Alone in the great
house... walking the streets alone,
her clothes becoming old and patched
and dirty... the Mad Carlotta...
stopping people in the streets to
ask, "Where is my child?... have you
seen my child?".



MIDGE: The poor thing....



SCOTTIE: And she died...



POP LEIBEL: She died.



SCOTTIE: How?



POP LEIBEL: By her own hand.



POP LEIBEL(Pause. Smiles as: sadly)
There are many such stories.



SCOTTIE: Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you
very much.



MIDGE: Hey, wait a minute! So long, Pop!
Thanks a lot!  She dashes out after
Scottie.



MIDGE: Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.



SCOTTIE: For what?



MIDGE: For bringing you here. Come on, tell!



SCOTTIE: Nothing to tell.



MIDGE: You'll tell, or you'll be back in
that corset! Come on!



SCOTTIE: I'll take you home.



SCOTTIE: Here you are.



MIDGE: You haven't told me everything.



SCOTTIE: I've told you enough.



MIDGE: Who's the guy, who's the wife?



SCOTTIE: Out. I've got things to do.



MIDGE: I know. The one who phoned. Your old
college chum, Elster.



SCOTTIE: Out!



MIDGE: And the idea is that the Beautiful
Mad Carlotta has come back from the
dead, to take possession of Elster's
wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!



SCOTTIE(Angrily): I'm not telling you what I think!
I'm telling you what he thinks!



MIDGE: Think?  Well, what do you think?



MIDGE: Is she pretty?



SCOTTIE: Carlotta?



MIDGE(Evenly): No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.



SCOTTIE: Mmm, yeah, I guess...



MIDGE(Wickedly): I think I'll go take a look at that
portrait.



MIDGE(Wickedly)(With a bright smile): Bye!



SCOTTIE(Outraged): Midge!



MIDGE: Bye-bye!



ELSTER(With a wan smile): You've done well, Scottie. You're
good at your job.



SCOTTIE: That's Carlotta Valdes.



ELSTER: Yes.



SCOTTIE: There are things you didn't tell me.



ELSTER: I didn't know where she was going to
lead you.



SCOTTIE: But you knew about this.



ELSTER: Oh, yes. You noticed the way she
does her hair.



ELSTER: Something else. My wife, Madeleine,
has several pieces of jewelry that
belonged to Carlotta. She inherited
them. Never wore them, they were too
old-fashioned... until now. Now,
when she is alone, she gets them out
and looks at them handles them gently,
curiously... puts them on and stares
at herself in the mirror... and goes
into that other world... is someone
else again.



SCOTTIE: Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's
grandmother?



ELSTER: Great-grandmother. The child who was
taken from her whose loss drove
Carlotta mad and to her death - was
Madeleine's grandmother.



SCOTTIE(Confidently): Well, that explains it. Anyone could
develop an obsession for the past,
with a background like that.



ELSTER: But she doesn't know, about her
background.



ELSTER(As Scottie stares,: narrowly)
She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.



SCOTTIE: Knows nothing of a grave out at
Mission Dolores, or an old house an
Eddy Street, or a portrait at the
Palace of the Legion of Honor?



ELSTER: Nothing.



SCOTTIE: And when she goes to those places...



ELSTER: She is not my wife.



SCOTTIE: How do you know all these things she
doesn't know?



ELSTER: Her mother told me most of then before
she died. I dug out the rest for
myself, here.



SCOTTIE: Why did she never tell her daughter?



ELSTER: Natural fear. Her grandmother went
insane and took her own life. And
the blood is in Madeleine.



ELSTER(Pause): Scottie, I ask you to watch her
closely.



SCOTTIE(whispering): Are you all right?



SCOTTIE(Calling softly): Madeleine...



MADELEINE(Faintly, distantly): Please... thank you... please...



MADELEINE(Appealingly): Where is my child?... have you seen
my child...?



SCOTTIE: Yes?... No, it's all right; I'll
call you back. Yes. Yes!



SCOTTIE: Are you all right?



SCOTTIE: Oh... you'll want this...



MADELEINE: Why am I here? What happened?



SCOTTIE: You...



SCOTTIE(Then, not liking the: sound of the truth)
...fell into the Bay.



SCOTTIE: I dried your hair as well as I could.
But you'd better come here by the
fire.



SCOTTIE: They're almost at dry. Here. Why
don't you come over here?



SCOTTIE: Would you like some coffee?



SCOTTIE: You'd better have some. Or would you
rather have a drink?



MADELEINE(Wonderingly): ...fell into the bay...



MADELEINE: ...and you fished me out...



MADELEINE: Thank you.



SCOTTIE: You don't remember.



MADELEINE: No...



SCOTTIE: Do you remember where you were?



MADELEINE(Childishly surprised): Oh, of course I remember that!  But
then I must have had a dizzy spell,
and fainted!



SCOTTIE(Quickly): Where were you?



MADELEINE: At...



MADELEINE(Triumphantly): ...Old Port Point!  Out at the
Presidio! Of course I remember! I
often go there!



SCOTTIE: Why?



MADELEINE(Almost naively): Because I love it so. It's beautiful
there. Especially at sunset.



MADELEINE(Almost naively)(She leans her head: back sensually to
the warmth)
Ah... thank you for the fire.



SCOTTIE: Where had you been before?



MADELEINE: When?



SCOTTIE: This afternoon.



MADELEINE: Oh... wandering about.



SCOTTIE: Before?  Where?  Where had you been?



MADELEINE(Positively): Downtown, shopping.



SCOTTIE: Please drink your coffee.



MADELEINE: I will. You're terribly direct in
your questions.



SCOTTIE: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.



MADELEINE: You're not. Merely direct. What were
you doing there? At Old Fort Point?



SCOTTIE: Wandering about.



MADELEINE: You like it, too.



MADELEINE(Then with a wicked: smile)
And where had you been?... just
before?



SCOTTIE: The Palace of the Legion of honor.
The Art Gallery.



MADELEINE(Enthusiastically): Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it?
I've never been inside. But it looks
so lovely, driving past.



MADELEINE(Softly): Lucky for me you were wandering about.
Thank you again. I've been terrible
bother to you.



SCOTTIE: No.



MADELEINE: When you...



MADELEINE(And suddenly conscious: of her nakedness
again, and embarrassed)
There were pins in my hair...



SCOTTIE: Oh! Yes! Here!



MADELEINE: Thank you.



MADELEINE: You shouldn't have brought me here,
you know.



SCOTTIE: I... didn't know where you lived.



MADELEINE: You could have looked in my car. Oh,
but you didn't know my car, did you?



SCOTTIE: Yes, I knew which one it was. It's
out there, now. But I didn't think
you'd want to be brought home that
way.



MADELEINE: No, you are right,



MADELEINE(Pause, as she works): I'm glad you didn't take me home...
I wouldn't have known you, to thank
you...



MADELEINE(Pause, as she works)(Suddenly appalled): Oh, but I don't know you! And you
don't know me! My name is Madeleine
Elster.



SCOTTIE: My name is John Ferguson.



MADELEINE: That's a good, strong name. Do your
friends call you John? Or Jack.



SCOTTIE: John. Old friends. Acquaintances
call me Scottie.



MADELEINE(Smiling): I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.



SCOTTIE(Grinning): No, I wouldn't like that. And after
what happened today I should think
you could call me Scottie. Or even
John.



MADELEINE: I prefer John. There, that's done.



MADELEINE(The hair is in order): And what do you do, John?



SCOTTIE: Wander about.



MADELEINE: That's a good occupation. And live
here... alone?



MADELEINE(softly): One shouldn't live alone.



SCOTTIE: Some people prefer it.



MADELEINE: No... it's wrong.



MADELEINE(Simply): I'm married, you know.



SCOTTIE: Will you tell me something? Has this
ever happened to you before?



MADELEINE(startled): What?



SCOTTIE: ...Falling... into San Francisco
Bay?



MADELEINE: No, never before. I've fallen into
lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a
little girl. And I fell into a river,
once, trying to leap from one stone
to another. But I've never fallen
into San Francisco Bay. Have you?
Ever before?



SCOTTIE(Grinning): No... this is the first time for me,
too.



SCOTTIE: Here, let me give you a lit --



SCOTTIE: Hello.



ELSTER'S VOICE: Scottie, what happened? She's not
home, yet.



SCOTTIE: No, she's all right. She's still
here. But I'll get her home soon.



ELSTER'S VOICE: What happened?



SCOTTIE: She... went into the Bay.



SCOTTIE: Hello?



ELSTER'S VOICE: Did she hurt herself?



SCOTTIE: No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to
worry about. But she doesn't know.
You understand that. She doesn't
know what she did.



ELSTER'S VOICE: Scottie... Madeleine is twenty-six.
Carlotta Valdes committed suicide
when she was twenty-six.



MIDGE(Softly): Well, now, Johnny-O... Was it a
ghost?... And was it fun?...



MIDGE: Oops!



SCOTTIE: Is that for me?



MADELEINE: Oh! Yes. Hello.



SCOTTIE: Good morning. I worried about you,
last night. You shouldn't have run
like that.



MADELEINE(Embarrassed): I... suddenly felt such a fool.



SCOTTIE: I wanted to drive you home. Are you
all right?



MADELEINE(Flashing a smile): Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.



MADELEINE(Flashing a smile)(Then, ruefully): But as I remember now, that water
was cold, wasn't it?



MADELEINE(Flashing a smile)(Then, ruefully)(He nods. She looks: away)
What a terrible thing to do... and
you were so kind...



MADELEINE(Flashing a smile)(Then, ruefully)(He nods. She looks(With a gesture): It's a formal thank-you letter. And
a great big apology.



SCOTTIE: You've nothing to apologize for.



MADELEINE: Oh, yes! The whole thing must have
been so embarrassing for you!



SCOTTIE: Not at all, I enjoyed --



SCOTTIE: -- talking to you...



MADELEINE(With small, contained: amusement)
I enjoyed talking to you.



SCOTTIE: I'll get my mail...



SCOTTIE: Would you like some coffee?



MADELEINE(Quickly): No! No, thank you!



MADELEINE: I couldn't mail it; I didn't know
your address. But I had a landmark.
I remembered Coit Tower and it led
me straight to you.



SCOTTIE: The first time I've been grateful
for Coit Tower.



SCOTTIE: I hope we will, too.



MADELEINE: What?



SCOTTIE: Meet again, sometime.



MADELEINE: We have.



MADELEINE: Good-bye.



SCOTTIE: Good-bye.



SCOTTIE(Suddenly walking): Where are you going?



MADELEINE: I don't know.



SCOTTIE: Shopping?



MADELEINE: No.



SCOTTIE: Well... anywhere in particular?



MADELEINE: No, I Just thought I'd wander.



SCOTTIE: Ah.



SCOTTIE(Then): That's what I was going to do.



MADELEINE: Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your
occupation, isn't it?



SCOTTIE: Don't you think it's sort of a waste
for the two of us to...



MADELEINE: Wander separately? Ah, but only one
is a wanderer. Two, together, are
always going somewhere.



SCOTTIE: No... no, I don't think that's
necessarily true.



MADELEINE(With a smiling nod): You left your door open.



SCOTTIE: Don't move!



SCOTTIE(Finally): Do you know where you're going?



MADELEINE: Of course not! I'm a wanderer!



MADELEINE(Pause. Then brightly): I'd like to go somewhere I've never
been!



SCOTTIE: How can you be sure?



MADELEINE: If I've been there? That's silly!
Either you've been to a place or you
haven't.



MADELEINE: How old?



SCOTTIE: Oh... some, two thousand years, or
more.



MADELEINE: The oldest living things?



SCOTTIE: You've never been here before.



SCOTTIE: What are you thinking?



MADELEINE(Searching): Of all the people who have been
born... and have died... while the
trees went on living.



SCOTTIE(Agreeing): Their true name is Sequoia
Sempervirens: always green, ever-
living.



MADELEINE(Flatly): I don't like them.



SCOTTIE: Why?



MADELEINE(Simply): Knowing I have to die...



MADELEINE: But I like the stream! It's a lovely
stream!



MADELEINE: But it makes no sound! Listen!



MADELEINE: Do you hear anything?



SCOTTIE(Shaking his head): Only silence. It's always like this.



MADELEINE(Wondering): And no birds sing.



SCOTTIE: No birds live here.



MADELEINE: No.



SCOTTIE: Would you like a drink of water?



MADELEINE: No, thank you.



MADELEINE: Somewhere in here I was born... and
here I died and it was only a moment
for you... you took no notice...



SCOTTIE(Almost sharply): Madeleine!



SCOTTIE(Gently): Madeleine...



SCOTTIE: Where are you now?



MADELEINE(Softly, distantly): Here with you.



SCOTTIE: Where?



MADELEINE: The tall trees...



SCOTTIE: Have you been here before?



MADELEINE: Yes...



SCOTTIE: When?



SCOTTIE: Where were you born?



MADELEINE: Long ago...



SCOTTIE: Where?



SCOTTIE: When?



SCOTTIE: Tell me.



SCOTTIE: Madeleine! Tell me!



MADELEINE: No!... No!



SCOTTIE(Low and urgent): Tell me what it is. Where do you go?
What takes you away?



MADELEINE: No, don't ask me!



SCOTTIE: When you jumped in the bay, you didn't
know where you were. You guessed but
you didn't know.



MADELEINE: I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I
fell!



SCOTTIE: Why did you jump?



MADELEINE: No!



SCOTTIE: What was it inside that told you to
jump?



MADELEINE: No, I can't tell you!



SCOTTIE: What?!



MADELEINE(Strongly): No! Please! Please, please, please,
please, don't ask me!



MADELEINE(Softly, tired): Take me away from here?



SCOTTIE: Home?



MADELEINE: ...somewhere in the light.



MADELEINE: And promise you won't ask me again.
Please promise me that.



MADELEINE: Why did you run?



SCOTTIE(Finally, quietly): I'm responsible for you now, you
know.  The Chinese say that once you
have saved someone's life, you are
responsible for it forever. And so
I'm committed. And I have to know.



MADELEINE: And you'll go on saving me? Again
and again?



MADELEINE: There is so little I know. It is as
though I were walking down a long
corridor that once was mirrored, and
fragments of mirror still hang there,
dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark
image of me... and yet not me...
someone else, in other clothes, of
another time, doing things I have
never done... but still me... And I
can't stop to ask why, I must keep
on walking. At the and of the corridor
there is nothing but darkness, and I
know when I walk into the darkness,
I'll die.



MADELEINE(Pause; she looks up): But I've never come to the and; I've
always come back, before then. Except
once.



SCOTTIE: Yesterday.



SCOTTIE: And you didn't know. You didn't know
what happened. Until you found
yourself there with me.



SCOTTIE: You don't know where you were.



SCOTTIE: But the small scenes, the fragments
in the mirror: you remember them.



MADELEINE: Vaguely...



SCOTTIE: What do you remember?



MADELEINE(Searching): A room... there is a room, and I sit
there alone... always alone...



SCOTTIE: Would you know the room?



MADELEINE: No... it's in shadow.



SCOTTIE: What else?



MADELEINE: A grave...



SCOTTIE: Where?



MADELEINE: I don't know. An open grave. I stand
by the gravestone looking down into
it. And it's my grave.



SCOTTIE: How do you know?



MADELEINE: I know.



SCOTTIE: There's a name on the gravestone.



MADELEINE: No. It's new and clean, and waiting.



SCOTTIE(Beginning to feel: lost)
What else?



MADELEINE(Searching): This part is dream, I think. There
is a tower and a bell and... a garden
below... but it seems to be in
Spain... a village in Spain. And
then it clicks off, and is gone.



SCOTTIE: A portrait? Do you ever see a
portrait?



MADELEINE: No.



SCOTTIE: Of the woman in the mirror. Would
you know her if you saw her?



MADELEINE: But I'm the woman in the mirror!



SCOTTIE(Desperately): No!



SCOTTIE(To himself): If I could find the key... find the
beginning put it together...



MADELEINE(Quietly, lost): And so explain it away?  But there
is a way to explain it, you see. If
I'm mad? That would explain it,
wouldn't it?



SCOTTIE: Madeleine!!



MADELEINE(Muffled, against his: breast)
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't
want to die, but there's someone
inside me, there's a somebody else,
and she says I must die... Scottie,
don't let me go!



SCOTTIE: I'm here, I've got you...



MADELEINE: I'm so afraid...



MADELEINE(She looks up): ...you won't let it happen...



MADELEINE(Whispering): Don't leave me... stay with me...



SCOTTIE: All the time.



SCOTTIE(Calling): Midge?



MIDGE: Hi, Johnny! Did you get my message?



SCOTTIE: I did. Since when do you go about
slipping notes under men's doors?



MIDGE: Since I stopped being able to get
them on the phone. For a man who has
nothing to do, you're certainly a
busy little bee. Where do you go,
these days?



SCOTTIE: Just wander.



MIDGE: Where?



SCOTTIE: Around.



MIDGE: Oh?



SCOTTIE: Mm. Better.



MIDGE: Did you need it?



SCOTTIE: Yeah.



MIDGE: Oh?



SCOTTIE: What was this desperate urge to see
me?



MIDGE: All I said in the note was: "Where
are you?" That doesn't sound desperate
to me.



SCOTTIE: Well, I detected an undercurrent.



MIDGE: I just thought if I gave you a drink
and fed you some dinner, you'd be so
grateful you'd take me to a movie.



SCOTTIE: Fair enough. What'll we talk about
at dinner?



MIDGE: Oh... this and that.



SCOTTIE: What I've been doing?



MIDGE: If you want to. Naturally, we won't
talk about anything you don't want
to talk about.



SCOTTIE: Naturally.



MIDGE(Innocently): What have you been doing?



SCOTTIE(With small grin): Wandering.



SCOTTIE: What have you been doing?



MIDGE: Oh, I'm having a wonderful time!
I've gone back to my first love...
painting.



SCOTTIE: Good. I've always said you were
wasting your time in the underwear
department.



MIDGE: Well, it's a living. But I'm excited
about this.



SCOTTIE: What is it, a still life?



MIDGE: No, not exactly. Want to see?



MIDGE: As a matter of fact, I thought I
might give it to you.



SCOTTIE(smiling, surprised): Oh?



SCOTTIE(Softly): Not funny, Midge.



MIDGE: Johnny!



MIDGE: But Johnny, I thought you would --



SCOTTIE(Nicely): We'll make that movie some other
night, huh?



MIDGE(Desperately apologetic): But Johnny...!!!



MIDGE: Ah, no!!



MIDGE: Oh! Marjorie Wood!! You fool!!



MIDGE(At the portrait): OH!!!!!



SCOTTIE: What's the matter?... What time is
it?... Madeleine, what's happened?



MADELEINE(Barely): I should have phoned... but I wanted
to see you... be with you...



SCOTTIE: Why? What's happened?



MADELEINE: I had the dream. The dream came back
again...



SCOTTIE: It's all right. You're all right,
I'll get you some brandy.



MADELEINE(Sharply): No, don't go away!



SCOTTIE: Only this far.



SCOTTIE: Here. Straight down, it's medicine.



SCOTTIE: Where's your husband?



MADELEINE: I didn't wake him. I don't want him
to know...



SCOTTIE: Here, now, it's going to be all right.
Here.



SCOTTIE: It was a dream, you're awake, you're
all right, now. Can you tell me?



MADELEINE: It was the tower again... and the
bell, and the old Spanish village...



SCOTTIE: Yes --



MADELEINE: But clear... so very clear... for
the first time... all of it...



SCOTTIE: Tell me.



MADELEINE: There was a village square, a green
with trees... and an old whitewashed
Spanish church with a cloister.
Across the green: a big, grey, wooden
house with a porch and shutters and
a balcony above... a small garden,
and next to it, a livery stable...
with old carriages lined up inside.



SCOTTIE: Go on.



MADELEINE: At the end of the green there was a
whitewashed stone house with a lovely
pepper tree at the corner --



SCOTTIE(Finishing it): -- and an old wooden hotel of the
old California days, and a saloon...
dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging
oil lamps.



MADELEINE: Yes?! But --



SCOTTIE(Gently): It's all there. It's no dream.



SCOTTIE: You've been there before. You've
seen it.



MADELEINE: No, never!



SCOTTIE: Madeleine, a hundred miles south of
San Francisco there's an old Spanish
Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista.
It's been preserved exactly as it
was a hundred years ago as a museum.
Now, think hard, darling. You've
been there before. You've seen it!



MADELEINE(Frightened): No, never! I've never been there!
Scottie, what is it? I've never been
there!



SCOTTIE(To himself): Carlotta...



SCOTTIE: What was it he said?  She came from
somewhere south of the city... some
say a mission settlement...



SCOTTIE: Madeleine, think hard!!



SCOTTIE(Quietly): Go on with your dream. What was it
that frightened you?



MADELEINE: I stood alone on the green, searching
for something, and I started to walk
to the church. But then the darkness
closed in, I was alone in the dark,
being pulled into darkness, and I
fought to wake up...



SCOTTIE: You're going to be all right now,
Madeleine. I've got something to
work on now. I'm going to take you
there -- to the Mission -- this
afternoon. And when you see it, you'll
remember when you saw it before, and
that will finish your dream and
destroy it. I promise.  You'll be
free.



SCOTTIE: All right?



SCOTTIE: I'll take you home. If your husband
is awake, say you couldn't sleep and
went out for some air. And come back
to me about noon. Come along.



MADELEINE: No, I'll go alone. I'm all right.



EL CAMINO REAL: MISSION SAN JUAN BAUTISTA FOUNDED
JUNE 24, 1797



SCOTTIE: Madeleine...?



SCOTTIE: Where are you now?



MADELEINE(Softly): Here with you.



SCOTTIE: And it's a all real.



MADELEINE: Yes.



SCOTTIE(Firmly): Not merely as it was a hundred years
ago. As it was a year ago, or six
months ago, whenever you were here
to see it.



SCOTTIE(Firmly)(Pressing): Madeleine, think of when you were
here!



MADELEINE(Dreamily): There were not so many carriages,
then. And there were horses in the
stalls; a bay, two black, and a grey.
It was her favorite place, but we
were forbidden to play here, and
Sister Teresa would scold us...



SCOTTIE: Well, now, here!



SCOTTIE: Here's your grey horse!  Course he'd
have a tough time getting in and out
of a stall without being pushed, but
still... You see?  There's an answer
for everything!



SCOTTIE: Madeleine! Try!



SCOTTIE: Madeleine, try... for me...



SCOTTIE: My love... because I love you.



MADELEINE(Whispering): I love you too... too late... too
late...



SCOTTIE: No... we're together...



MADELEINE: Too late... there's something I must
do...



SCOTTIE(murmuring): Nothing you must do... no one
possesses you... you're safe with
me... my love...



MADELEINE: Too late...



SCOTTIE(Firmly): There are things I have to tell you,
about how we met, and why we are
together. But they can wait. The
only important thing now is that I
love you and I'm going to keep you
safe.



MADELEINE(Trembling): You can't.



SCOTTIE: Why?



MADELEINE: Let me go.



SCOTTIE: Where?



MADELEINE: To the church, I must go there.



SCOTTIE: Madeleine --



MADELEINE: Please let me go.



SCOTTIE: Madeleine, don't fight me off, don't
put me away. You've been fighting
alone, and you're lost, but no more.
Hold on to me. Be sure of me, always.
And whatever it is, we'll lick it. I
promise.



MADELEINE(Head low, brokenly): It's not fair, it's too late. It
wasn't supposed to happen this way,
it shouldn't have happened...!



SCOTTIE: It had to. We're in love. That's all
that counts. Madeleine --



MADELEINE(Frantic, struggling): Let me go! Let me go!!



SCOTTIE(Holding her; sharply): Madeleine!!



MADELEINE: You believe that I love you?



SCOTTIE: Yes.



MADELEINE: And if you lose me, you'll know that
I loved you and wanted to go on loving
you.



SCOTTIE: I won't lose you.



MADELEINE: Let me go into the church alone.



SCOTTIE: Why?



MADELEINE: Please. Because I love you.  He stares
at her, sees the pleading look in
her eyes, and lets go. She turns and
walks away toward the church, slowly,
her head bowed. He watches her go
and starts to move after her. Then
slowly, as she goes, her head begins
to go up until finally, as she walks,
she is staring high above her.  And
then, suddenly, she breaks into a
broken run.



SCOTTIE: Madeleine!!!



(NOTE: THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE FOLLOWING SPEECH COVERS: THE RISE AND ENTRANCE OF THE CAMERA AND BECOMES INTELLIGIBLE
ONLY AT ITS END.)



OFFICIAL: Mr. Elster, suspecting that all was
not well with his wife's mental state,
took the preliminary precaution of
having her watched by Mr. Ferguson
lest any harm befall her, and you
have heard that Mr. Elster was
prepared to take his wife to an
institution where her mental health
would have been in the hand of
qualified specialists.  And Mr.
Ferguson, being an ex-detective,
would have seemed the proper choice
for the role of watchdog and
protector. As you have learned, it
was an unfortunate choice.



OFFICIAL(pause): However, I think you will agree that
no blame can be attached to the
husband. His delay in putting his
wife under medical care was due only
to the need information as to her
behavior that he expected to get
from Mr. Ferguson. He had taken every
precaution to protect his wife. He
could not have anticipated that Mr.
Ferguson's "weakness" his "fear of
heights", called "acrophobia", would
make him powerless when he was most
needed.



OFFICIAL(pause)(pause): As to Mr. Ferguson: you have heard
his former superior, Detective Captain
Hansen, from that great city to the
north, testify as to his character
and ability. Captain Hansen was most
enthusiastic. The fact that Mr.
Ferguson once before, under similar
circumstances, allowed a police
colleague to tall to his death,
Captain Hansen dismissed as an
"unfortunate Incident."



OFFICIAL: Of course Mr. Ferguson is to be
congratulated for having once saved
the woman's life when, in a previous
fit of aberration, she threw herself
into the Bay. It is a pity that
knowing her suicidal tendencies he
did not make a greater effort the
second time. But we are not here to
pass judgment on Mr. Ferguson's lack
of initiative. He did nothing, and
the law has little to say on the
subject of things left undone.



OFFICIAL(pause): Nor does his strange behavior after
he saw the body fall have any bearing
on your verdict. He did not remain
at the scone of the death. He ran
away.  He claims he suffered a mental
blackout and knew nothing more until
he found himself back in his own
apartment in San Francisco several
hours later. You may accept that or
not. Or, you may believe that, having
once again allowed someone to die,
he could not face the tragic result
of his own weakness, and ran away.
That has nothing to do with your
verdict.  It is a matter between him
and his conscience.



OFFICIAL(pause)(pause): Now. From the evidence of the mind
of Madeleine Elster prior to her
death, from the manner of her death,
and from the Postmortem examination
of the body showing the actual cause
of her death, you should have no
difficulty in reaching your verdict.
Gentlemen, you may retire.



FOREMAN: We've reached the verdict.



OFFICIAL: And what is your verdict.



FOREMAN: We find that Madeleine Elster
committed suicide while being out of --
while being out of unsound mind.



OFFICIAL: Your verdict will be so recorded.
Dismissed.



HANSEN: Let's go, Scottie.



HANSEN(Glares over at the: Official grimly)
The son of a --



ELSTER: Do you mind if I speak to him for a
minute?



ELSTER: Scottie --



ELSTER: Scottie, I'm sorry. That was rough.



ELSTER: He had no right to say that. It was
my responsibility. You didn't know
her. I shouldn't have got you
involved.



SCOTTIE(struggling): I -- I --



ELSTER: No, there's nothing you have to say
to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For
good. I can't stay here. I'm winding
up her affairs, and mine. I'm going
to get as far away as I can. Probably
Europe. And I'll probably never come
back.



ELSTER(Extends his hand): Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything
I can do for you before I go...



ELSTER: There was no way for them to
understand. But you and I know who
killed Madeleine.



MIDGE(Brightly): It's Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus. I had
a long talk with the lady in musical
therapy, and she said Mozart's the
boy for you, Johnny. The broom that
sweeps the cobwebs away. That's what
the lady said. You know, it's
wonderful how they've got it all
taped now, John. They've got music
for melancholiacs, and music for
dipsomaniacs, and music for
nymphomaniacs... I wonder what would
happen if somebody mixed up their
files?



MIDGE: But I brought you a lot of other
things. You can see what you like.
And the thing shuts off automatically.



MIDGE: Ah, Johnny, please try. Johnny, try!
You're not lost. Mother's here.



MIDGE: Time? Okay.



MIDGE: I'll be in again, John. Do you want
me to shut that off? It shuts off
automatically.



MIDGE(Softly): Ah, Johnny-O... you don't know I'm
here, do you?



MIDGE: But I'm here.



MIDGE: Could I see the doctor for a moment?



NURSE: Doctor...?



DOCTOR: Oh. Yes, Miss Wood?



MIDGE: Doctor, how long is it going to take
you to pull him out of this?



DOCTOR: It is hard to say. Six months, at
least. Perhaps a year. It depends to
a certain extent on him.



MIDGE: He won't talk.



DOCTOR: No. We have ways of digging out
knowledge. But it takes longer. He
is suffering from acute melancholia,
together with a guilt complex. He
blames himself for what happened to
the woman. And we know little of the
background.



MIDGE: I can give you one thing: he was in
love with her.



DOCTOR: Ah? That complicates the problem.



MIDGE: I'll give you another complication:
he still is.



MIDGE: And you know something, Doctor?  I
don't think Mozart's going to help
at all.



SCOTTIE: Where did you get this car?!



THE WOMAN(Startled by his: vehemence)
I beg your pardon?



SCOTTIE: This car...!!



THE WOMAN: Oh!  Why... I bought it from a man
who used to live here, in this
apartment building. Mister Gavin
Elster. I bought it from him when he
moved away.



THE WOMAN: 0h! You know him! And his wife? The
poor thing. I didn't know her. Tell
me -- is it true that she really
believed --



SCOTTIE: I'm sorry.



JUDY: Well? What is it?



SCOTTIE: Could I ask you a couple of questions?



JUDY: What for? Who are you?



SCOTTIE: My name is John Ferguson, and --



JUDY: Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or
something?



SCOTTIE: No, there are just a few things I
want to ask you, and --



JUDY: Do you live here in the hotel?



SCOTTIE: No, I happened to see you come in,
and I thought --



JUDY: 0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well,
you've got a nerve, following me
right into the hotel and up to my
room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!



SCOTTIE: No, please! I Just want to talk to
you!



JUDY(Pushing on the door): Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!



SCOTTIE: I'm not going to hurt you! I promise!
Please!



SCOTTIE: Just let me talk to you.



JUDY(Hesitating): What about?



SCOTTIE: You.



JUDY: Why?



SCOTTIE: Because you remind me of someone.



JUDY: I've heard that one before, too. I
remind you of someone you used to be
madly in love with, but she ditched
you for another guy, and you've been
carrying the torch ever since, and
then you saw me and something clicked.



JUDY(scornfully): Huh!



SCOTTIE(With a rueful smile): You're not far wrong.



JUDY: Well, it's not going to work. So
you'd better go.



SCOTTIE: Let me come in.



SCOTTIE: You can leave the door open. Please.
I want to talk to you.



JUDY: I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.



SCOTTIE: You won't have to.



JUDY(Doubtfully): Well... you don't look very much
like Jack the Ripper...



JUDY: What do you want to know?



SCOTTIE: Your name. And --



JUDY: Judy Barton.



SCOTTIE: Who you are --



JUDY: Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --



SCOTTIE: -- and how you happen to be living
here.



JUDY: It's a place to live, that's all.



SCOTTIE: But you haven't lived here long.



JUDY: About three years.



SCOTTIE: No, a year ago! Where did you live a
year ago!!?



JUDY(Puzzled): I told you! Right here!



SCOTTIE(Strongly): But before! Where did you live
before!?!



JUDY: Salina, Kansas!



JUDY: Listen, what is this? What do you
want?



SCOTTIE: I want to know who you are.



JUDY: I told you! My name is Judy Barton!
I come from Salina Kansas. I work at
Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I
have to prove it?



JUDY: You've got to prove you're alive
these days! All right, Mister. My
Kansas driver's license. Judy Barton.
Number Z296794. Four-Twenty-Five
Maple Avenue, Salina, Kansas.



JUDY: There! See the address on this one?
This place here! California License
issued May 25, 1954! Want to check
my thumb print? Satisfied.



JUDY(Pulls the card away): And whether you're satisfied or not,
you can just beat it!



JUDY(Gently): Gee, you have got it bad, haven't
you?  Do I really look like her?



JUDY: She's dead, isn't she.



JUDY: I'm sorry. And I'm sorry I yelled at
you.



JUDY: Yes, that's me. With my mother.



JUDY: That's my father. He's dead. My mother
got married again... I didn't like
the guy.



JUDY(Smiles, wistfully): So... I decided to see what it was
like in sunny California.



JUDY(Smiles, wistfully)(Pause): I've been here three years.



JUDY(Smiles, wistfully)(Pause)(she grins): Honest!



SCOTTIE: Will you have dinner with me?



JUDY(Immediately wary,: the smile fading)
Why?



SCOTTIE: Well, I feel I owe you something for
all this...



JUDY: No, you don't owe me anything.



SCOTTIE: Then will you for me?



JUDY(Warily): Dinner... and what else?



SCOTTIE: Just dinner.



JUDY: Because I remind you of her?



SCOTTIE: Because I'd like to have dinner with
you.



JUDY(Slowly): Well... I've been on blind dates
before... Matter of fact, to be
honest, I've been picked up before.



JUDY(Slowly)(Grins): Okay.



SCOTTIE: I'll get my car and be back in half
an hour.



JUDY: Oh, no! Give me time to change and
get fixed up!



SCOTTIE: An hour?



JUDY: Mmm.



SCOTTIE: Okay.



JUDY'S VOICE: Dearest Scottie ... and so you've
found me. This is the moment I dreaded
and hoped for, -- wondering what I
would say and do if ever I saw you
again, I wanted so to see you again.
Just once. Now I'll go and you can
give up your search.



JUDY'S VOICE(pause): I want you to have peace of mind.
You've nothing to blame yourself
for.  You were the victim. I was the
tool, you were the victim of a man's
plan to murder his wife. He chose me
to play the part because I looked
like her; he dressed me up like her.
He was quite safe because she lived
in the country and rarely came to
town. He chose you to be the witness.
The Carlotta story was part real,
part invented to make you testify
that Madeleine wanted to kill herself.
He knew of your illness; he knew you
would never get up the stairs of the
tower. He planned it so well; he
made no mistakes.



JUDY'S VOICE(pause)(pause): I made the mistake. I fell in love.
That wasn't part of the plan. I'm
still in love with you, and I want
you so to love me. If I had the nerve,
I would stay and lie, hoping that I
could make you love me again, as I
am for myself... and so forget the
other and forget the past. But I
haven't the nerve to try...



JUDY: Thank you again. Good-night.



SCOTTIE: Can I see you tomorrow?



JUDY: Tomorrow night? Well --



SCOTTIE: Tomorrow morning.



JUDY: Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to
work. I've got a job.



SCOTTIE: Don't go.



JUDY(Smiling): And what will I live on? My oil wells
in Texas?



SCOTTIE: I'll take care of you.



JUDY(Flatly): Oh, Well, thank very much. But no
thanks.



SCOTTIE: No, Judy, you don't understand.



JUDY: Oh, I understand, all right. I've
been understanding since I was
seventeen. And the next step is, as
long as you're going to see me
tomorrow, why don't you stay the
night.



SCOTTIE: No.



JUDY: No? Then what?



SCOTTIE: I just want to see you as much as I
can!



JUDY: As friends? We'd just see a lot of
each other as friends, and you'd
"take care of me"?



SCOTTIE: Yes.



JUDY: Why?



JUDY(No answer): Because I remind you of someone?



JUDY(No answer)(No answer): That's not very complimentary.



JUDY(No answer)(No answer)(Pause): And nothing would... happen...



SCOTTIE: No.



JUDY: That's not very complimentary, either.



JUDY(Frightened): Listen, what'd you do that for?!?!



SCOTTIE(Quickly): No, Judy, I'm not going to move!
Please! Stay in the chair!



JUDY: Why?!



SCOTTIE: Please! And don't look at me.



SCOTTIE(Softly): Will you, Judy?



JUDY(Slowly, anxiously): I suppose I could phone the store in
the morning, and say I'm sick.



SCOTTIE(Gently): Good night, Judy.



JUDY: I like that one.



SCOTTIE: No, there. There's a good one. Do
you like that?



JUDY: Yes --



SCOTTIE: We'll take that one.



VENDOR: Very nice. And fresh. I just made it
up.



VENDOR: That'll be a dollar four.  Scottie
pays him



JUDY: It's beautiful.



SCOTTIE: Okay. Now we're going to buy you
some clothes.



JUDY: Honest?



SCOTTIE: There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the
best. Come on.



JUDY(Happy and breathless): But Scottie, you don't have to!



SCOTTIE: I want to! Come on!



SCOTTIE: No, that's not it. Nothing like it.



SALESWOMAN: But you said grey, sir.



SCOTTIE: Not tweed -- it's a smoother material,
with a larger collar and belted.



JUDY: But I like that one, Scottie.



SCOTTIE: No, it's not right.



SALESWOMAN(Cheerfully): The gentleman seems to know what he
wants.



SALESWOMAN(Cheerfully)(To the model): All right. Well, we'll find it.



JUDY(Slightly apprehensive): Scottie, what are you doing?



SCOTTIE: I'm trying to buy you a suit.



JUDY: But I loved the second one she wore.
And this one --



JUDY(She touches a suit: on the chair)
-- is beautiful.



SCOTTIE: They're none of them right.



JUDY: But why?



SALESWOMAN: Oh!!  I think I know the suit you
mean!  We had it -- oh, it must be
sometime ago!  Let me go see. We may
still have the model.



JUDY: You're looking for the suit she wore!
For me?!?



JUDY(Repelled): You want me to dress like her?



SCOTTIE: Judy, I just want you to look nice.
And I know what kind of suit would
look well on you.



JUDY: Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed
like someone dead!



SCOTTIE: Judy --



JUDY: It's a horrible idea! Is that what
I'm here for? To make you feel that
you're with someone that's dead?



SALESWOMAN: She'll be out in a moment.



SCOTTIE: Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --



JUDY: No, I won't do it!!



SCOTTIE: Judy!!



SCOTTIE: Judy, it can't make much difference
to you. I just want to see how you'd
look and I know it won't be the same,
but --



JUDY: No, I don't want any clothes! I don't
want anything! I want to get out of
here!



SCOTTIE(strongly): Judy, you've got to do this for me!
Please!



SCOTTIE: Yes! That's it!



SALESWOMAN: I thought so!



JUDY: I don't like it!



SCOTTIE: We'll take it! Will it fit?



SALESWOMAN: Oh, yes! It may need some slight
alterations, but it is madam's size.



SALESWOMAN(To the model): All right, dear.



SALESWOMAN(To the model)(To Judy): We'll have it for you to try in a
moment.



SCOTTIE: How soon can it be altered?



SALESWOMAN: Well...



SCOTTIE: Can we have it by tonight?



SALESWOMAN: Well, if it's absolutely necessary...



SCOTTIE: Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at
an evening dress, a dinner dress,
black -- short -- long sleeves --
with a neck cut this...



SCOTTIE(Indicates square: neck)
...and the skirt out.



SCOTTIE(Indicates square(Indicates full skirt: with his hands)



JUDY(Appealing): Scottie --



SALESWOMAN(Laughs, embarrassed): My, you certainly do know what you
want, sir. I'll see what we have.



SCOTTIE'S VOICE: All right. Walk.



SCOTTIE: All right. That's it. Do you have in
black, too?



SALESMAN: Yes, we have.



SCOTTIE: All right.



SCOTTIE: Here, Judy. Take it straight down.
It's medicine.



JUDY(Pleading): Why are you doing this? What good
will it do?



SCOTTIE: I don't know. No good, I guess. But
I don't know.



JUDY(Tearfully): I wish you'd leave me alone. I want
to go away.



SCOTTIE: You can.



JUDY: No, you wouldn't let me.



JUDY(Then, almost to: herself)
And I don't want to go...



SCOTTIE: Judy, I want to tell you: these few
days have been the first happy days
I've had in a year.



JUDY(Sadly): I know. Because I remind you of her.
The one that's dead. And not even
that, very much.



SCOTTIE(Meaning it): No, it's you too, Judy. Something in
you.



JUDY(Dully): You don't even want to touch me.



SCOTTIE(Grimly): Yes. Yes, I do.



JUDY: Couldn't you like me, just me, the
way I am?! When we first started out
it was so good! We had fun! And you
started on the clothes! I'll wear
the darned clothes if you want me
to! If you just like me!



SCOTTIE(Studying): The color of your hair...



JUDY: Ah, no!



SCOTTIE: Judy, please it can't matter to you...



JUDY: The trouble is, I'm gone now. For
you. And I can't do anything about
it. I want you to love me. If I let
you change me, will that do it? If I
do what you tell me, will you love
me?



SCOTTIE: Yes.



JUDY: All right. Then I'll do it. Because
I don't care about me anymore. I
just want you to love me.



SCOTTIE(Gently): I'll take you home.



OPERATOR: I'm afraid it's going to be several
hours. The young lady thought perhaps
you'd like to go home, and she'll
come there as soon as she's finished.



SCOTTIE: Oh!  Well... no. Tell her I'll go to
her hotel, and wait for her there.



SCOTTIE: Oh! You're sure about the color of
the hair.



OPERATOR: 0h, yes. It's an easy color.



SCOTTIE: And the rest of --



OPERATOR: Yes, sir. We know what you want.



SCOTTIE: All right. Thanks.



JUDY: Well?



SCOTTIE: It should be back from your face --
with a bun at the neck. I told them.
I told you.



JUDY: We tried it. It didn't suit me.



SCOTTIE: I'm sorry.



SCOTTIE: Judy -- please --



JUDY: Where shall we go for dinner?



SCOTTIE: Wherever you'd like...



JUDY: Ernie's?



SCOTTIE: You've got a thing about Ernie's,
haven't you?



JUDY: Well, after all, it's "our place."



JUDY: Hello, my love. Like me?



SCOTTIE: Mmmm.



JUDY: Is that the best you can do?



SCOTTIE: Come here.



JUDY: Oh, no. You'll muss me.



SCOTTIE: That's what I had in mind.



JUDY: Too late. I've got my face on.



JUDY: I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather
go somewhere else?



SCOTTIE: No, Ernie's is fine.



JUDY: I'm going to have one of those big
beautiful steaks.  And... let's see...
to start...



JUDY: Oh! Help me with this, will you?



SCOTTIE: I've got it.  He bends down and bites
the back of her neck.



JUDY: Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!



SCOTTIE: All in good time.



JUDY: Scottie!



SCOTTIE: How does it work?



JUDY: Can't you see?



SCOTTIE: Oh, yeah. There.



JUDY'S VOICE: Thank you, darling. Now I'm just
about ready; I just have to find my
lipstick. Where did I put it? I had
it a minute ago.



JUDY'S VOICE(Her voice fading): Did I leave it in here? Oh, yes,
here it is!



JUDY'S VOICE(Her voice fading)(Her voice fading in): All right, I'm ready.



JUDY: But first... muss me a little.



JUDY: Ah, Scottie... I do have you, now...



SCOTTIE(Softly): How would you like to go somewhere
out of town for dinner?  Drive down
the peninsula, somewhere?



JUDY: All right, if you'd like.



JUDY: We're going awfully far.



SCOTTIE: I feel like driving. Are you terrible
hungry?



JUDY: No, it's all right.



JUDY: Where are you going?



SCOTTIE(wryly): To complete my cure.



SCOTTIE: One final thing I have to do, and
then I'll be rid of the past, forever.



JUDY: Scottie, why are we here?



SCOTTIE: I told you. I have to go back into
the past. Once more. For the last
time.



JUDY: But why? Why here?



SCOTTIE: Madeleine died here.



JUDY: No, I don't want to go. I want to
stay here.



SCOTTIE: I need you.



JUDY: Why?



SCOTTIE: I can't do it alone. I need you, to
be Madeleine for a while. Then, when
it's done, we'll both be free.



JUDY: I'm scared.



SCOTTIE: So am I, But it has to be done. I
have to tell you about Madeleine,
now.



SCOTTIE: There...



SCOTTIE: ...We stood there and I kissed her
for the last time. And she said, "If
lose me, you'll know that I loved
you --



JUDY(Pleading): Scottie --



SCOTTIE(Going right on): -- and wanted to go on loving you."
And I said, "I won't lose you."



SCOTTIE(Going right on)(pause): But I did.



SCOTTIE'S VOICE: She turned and ran... into the
Church...



SCOTTIE: ...And when I followed her, it was
too late...



JUDY(Frightened): I don't want to go in there!



SCOTTIE: ...too late...



SCOTTIE: I couldn't find her. Then I heard
her footsteps on the stairs, she was
running up the tower.



SCOTTIE'S VOICE: She ran up those stairs... and through
the door at the top of the tower,
and locked it behind her. Then she
jumped.



SCOTTIE: And I couldn't follow her.



SCOTTIE(He closes his eyes: in the agony of
remembering)
God knows I tried.



SCOTTIE(He closes his eyes(He glances down): One doesn't often get a second chance.
I want to stop being haunted. You're
my second chances, Judy.



JUDY(A frightened whisper): Take me away...



SCOTTIE: You look like Madeleine, now. Go up
the stairs.



JUDY: No!



SCOTTIE: Go up the stairs, Judy.



SCOTTIE(Pushing her to the: step)
I'll follow.



SCOTTIE(Quietly): This was as far as I could get. But
you went on. Remember?



SCOTTIE: The necklace, Madeleine. That was
the slip. I remembered the necklace.



SCOTTIE: We're going up the tower, Madeleine.



JUDY: No! Let me go!



SCOTTIE: We're going up the tower.



JUDY: You can't. You're afraid!



SCOTTIE: I'm going to. It's my second chance.



JUDY: Scottie, please...!



SCOTTIE: But you knew, that day, that I
wouldn't be able to follow you didn't
you. Who was at the top when you got
there? Elster? With his wife?



JUDY: Yes!



SCOTTIE: And she was the one who died. Not
you.  The real wife.  You were the
copy, you were the counterfeit. Was
she dead or alive when you got there?



JUDY: Dead. He'd broken her neck.



SCOTTIE: Took no chances, did he?  And when
you got there, he pushed her off the
tower, was that it? But you were the
one who screamed. Why did you scream?



JUDY: I wanted to stop it, I ran up to
stop it --



SCOTTIE: Why? Since you'd tricked me so well
up to then?!! You played his wife so
well, Judy! He made you over, didn't
he? Just as I've done. But better!
Not just the hair and the clothes!
the look! the manner! the words!
Those beautiful phony trances! That
jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're
really a strong swimmer, aren't you!
Aren't you!!



SCOTTIE: Did he train you? Rehearse you?
Teach you what to say and what to
do?



JUDY: Yes!



SCOTTIE: And you were such an apt pupil! What
fun you two must have had, playing
games with me! Why me? Why did he
pick on me?!!



JUDY: Your accident...



SCOTTIE: Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the
made-to-order witness. Where is he
now?



JUDY: I don't know... Switzerland?



SCOTTIE: We'll find him.



SCOTTIE: I made it.



JUDY(Apprehensive): What are you going to do?



SCOTTIE: Look at the scene of the crime. Go
on in.



SCOTTIE: Go on!



SCOTTIE: You both hid behind there, mmm?...
'til everything was clear... then
sneaked down and drove back to the
city.



SCOTTIE(Glances at her): And then? You were his girl. What
happened to you?



SCOTTIE: Did he ditch you?



SCOTTIE: Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money,
and the freedom and the power...  he
ditched you? What a shame! But he
knew he was safe. You couldn't talk.
Didn't he give you anything?



JUDY(Faintly): Some money.



SCOTTIE: And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace.
That was your mistake, Judy. One
shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing.
You shouldn't have been that
sentimental.



JUDY(Apprehensive): What are you going to do?



SCOTTIE: I loved you, Madeleine.



JUDY(Desperately): I was safe when you found me, there
was nothing you could prove! But
when I saw you again I couldn't run
away, I loved you so! I walked into
danger and let you change me again
because I loved you and wanted you!



JUDY(Desperately)(She throws herself: into his arms)
Scottie, please! You love me now!
Love me! Keep me safe!



JUDY(softly, pleading): Love me... keep me safe...



SCOTTIE(Whispering): Too late... too late... there's no
bringing her back.



JUDY(Whispering): No... no...



THE NUN(Simply): I heard voices...



THE NUN: God have mercy...
