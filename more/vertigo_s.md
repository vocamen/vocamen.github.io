1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,166
POLICEMAN: Give me your hand!

2
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,833
POLICEMAN: What's the matter with you? Give me
your hand!

3
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:28,125
SCOTTIE: Ow!!

4
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:31,125
MIDGE(Paying little: attention)
I thought you said no more aches and
pains?

5
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,125
SCOTTIE: It's this darned corset. It binds.
He retrieves the stick.

6
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,208
MIDGE: No three-way stretch? How very un-
chic.

7
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:39,500
SCOTTIE: Well, you know those police department
doctors: no sense of style.

8
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,083
SCOTTIE(Sighs gratefully): Ah, tomorrow!

9
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:40,666
MIDGE: What's tomorrow?

10
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:44,250
SCOTTIE: Tomorrow... the corset comes off.
And this thing goes out the window.

11
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,416
SCOTTIE(He waves the stick): I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle
my behind... free and unconfined.

12
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,791
SCOTTIE: Midge, do you suppose many men wear
corsets?

13
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:54,958
MIDGE: More than you think.

14
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,750
SCOTTIE(Interested): How do you know? Personal experience?

15
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,041
MIDGE: Please!

16
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,541
MIDGE(Then, impersonally): And what happens after tomorrow?

17
00:01:58,541 --> 00:01:59,708
SCOTTIE: What do you mean?

18
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:03,583
MIDGE: What are you going to do? Now that
you've quit the police force?

19
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,083
SCOTTIE(Gently): You sound so disapproving, Midge.

20
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:11,958
MIDGE: No, it's your life. But you were the
bright young lawyer who decided he
was going to be chief of police some
day.

21
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,458
SCOTTIE(Gently): I had to quit, Midge.

22
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:13,750
MIDGE: Why?

23
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,125
SCOTTIE: I wake up at night seeing him fall
from the roof... and try to reach
out for him.

24
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,291
MIDGE: It wasn't your fault.

25
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,791
SCOTTIE: I know. Everybody tells me.

26
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,291
MIDGE: Johnny, the doctors explained --

27
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:29,875
SCOTTIE: I know. I have Acrophobia. What a
disease. A fear of heights. And what
a moment to find out I had it.

28
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:35,250
MIDGE: Well, you've got it. And there's no
losing it. And there's no one to
blame. So why quit?

29
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,041
SCOTTIE: And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?

30
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,208
MIDGE: It's where you belong.

31
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:45,375
SCOTTIE(With a grin): Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I
dropped a pencil on the floor and
bent down to pick it up, it could be
disastrous!

32
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:45,958
MIDGE(Laughs): Ah, Johnny-O...

33
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,125
MIDGE(Finally, as she works): Well?... what'll you do?

34
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:54,625
SCOTTIE: Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm
a man of independent means. Or fairly
independent.

35
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,291
MIDGE: Mmm. Why don't you go away for a
while?

36
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:01,166
SCOTTIE(Grins): To forget? Don't be so motherly,
Midge. I'm not going to crack up.

37
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,541
MIDGE: Have you had any dizzy spells this
week?

38
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,708
SCOTTIE: I'm having one now.

39
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,583
SCOTTIE: From that music.

40
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:07,875
MIDGE: Oh!

41
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,041
SCOTTIE: What's this do-hickey here?

42
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,916
MIDGE: It's a brassiere. You know about
those things. You're a big boy, now.

43
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,000
SCOTTIE: I've never run across one like that.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,083
MIDGE: It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift.
No shoulder straps, no back straps,
but does everything a brassiere should
do. It works on the principle of the
cantilever bridge.

45
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:27,375
SCOTTIE(Impressed): Uh-huh!

46
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:32,166
MIDGE: An aircraft engineer down the
peninsula designed it. He worked it
out in his spare time.

47
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,333
SCOTTIE: What a pleasant hobby.

48
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,833
SCOTTIE: How's your love life, Midge?

49
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,625
MIDGE: That's following a train of thought.

50
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:38,916
SCOTTIE: Well?

51
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:39,208
MIDGE: Normal.

52
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,291
SCOTTIE: Aren't you ever going to get married?

53
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,875
MIDGE(Lightly): You know there's only one man in the
world for me, Johnny-O.

54
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,166
SCOTTIE: Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged
once though, weren't we?

55
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,041
MIDGE: Three whole weeks.

56
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:57,416
SCOTTIE: Ah, sweet college days. But you're
the one who blew it. I'm still
available. Available Ferguson. Say,
Midge, do you remember a guy at
college named Gavin Elster?

57
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,791
MIDGE: Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd
would. No.

58
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:07,583
SCOTTIE: I got a call from him today. Funny.
He dropped out of sight during the
war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I
guess he's back.

59
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,375
SCOTTIE(he fishes out a slip: of paper)
It's a Mission number.

60
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,875
MIDGE: That's Skid Row... isn't it?

61
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,458
SCOTTIE: Could be.

62
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:16,250
MIDGE: He's probably on the bum and wants
to touch you for the price of a drink.

63
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:25,250
SCOTTIE: Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a
couple of drinks and tell him my
troubles. But not tonight. If you
won't drink with me, I'll drink alone,
tonight.

64
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,416
MIDGE: Sorry, old man. Work.

65
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,083
SCOTTIE: Midge, what did you mean, there's no
losing it?

66
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:29,375
MIDGE: What.

67
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,250
SCOTTIE: My... the acrophobia.

68
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:38,916
MIDGE: I asked my doctor. He said only
another emotional shock could do it,
and probably wouldn't. And you're
not going to go diving off another
rooftop to find out.

69
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,708
SCOTTIE: I think I can lick it.

70
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,000
MIDGE: How?

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
SCOTTIE: I've got a theory. Look. If I can
get used to heights just a little at
a time... progressively see?

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,291
SCOTTIE: Here, I'll show you what I mean.
We'll start with this.

73
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:52,583
MIDGE: That!?!

74
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,458
SCOTTIE: What do you want me to start with --
the Golden Gate Bridge?

75
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:03,250
SCOTTIE: Now. I look up, I look down. I look
up, I look down. Nothing to it.

76
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,750
MIDGE(Overlapping): Stop kidding. Wait a minute.

77
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,250
SCOTTIE: Ah, that's my girl! Here?

78
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,125
MIDGE: Step number two.

79
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:11,416
SCOTTIE: Okay.

80
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:21,791
SCOTTIE: I look up, I look down. I look up, I
look down. I'm going to go right out
and buy me a nice, tall stepladder.
Here we go.

81
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:24,375
MIDGE: Easy, now.

82
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:28,541
SCOTTIE: This is a cinch. I look up, I look
down. I look up --

83
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:43,833
MIDGE: Johnny!

84
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,416
SCOTTIE(Muttering, his face: tight, his eyes shut)
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --

85
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,791
SCOTTIE: How'd you get into the shipbuilding
business, Gavin?

86
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,958
ELSTER: I married into it.

87
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:05,541
SCOTTIE: Interesting business.

88
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,916
ELSTER: No, to be honest, I find it dull.

89
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,583
SCOTTIE: You don't have to do it for a living.

90
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:26,166
ELSTER: No. But one assumes obligations. My
wife's family is all gone; someone
has to look after her interest. Her
father's partner runs the company
yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so
I decided as long as I had to work
at it, I'd come back here. I've always
liked it here.

91
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,958
SCOTTIE: How long have you been back?

92
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:28,833
ELSTER: Almost a year.

93
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,000
SCOTTIE: And you like it.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,500
ELSTER: San Francisco's changed. The things
a that spell San Francisco to me are
disappearing fast.

95
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,375
SCOTTIE: Like all this.

96
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:41,875
ELSTER(Nodding): I'd like to have lived here then.
The color and excitement... the
power...  the freedom.

97
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,375
ELSTER: Shouldn't you be sitting down?

98
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,541
SCOTTIE: No, I'm all right.

99
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,833
ELSTER: I was sorry to read about that thing
in the papers.

100
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,333
ELSTER(No answer): And you've quit the force.

101
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,500
ELSTER(No answer)(Scottie nods): A permanent physical disability?

102
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:01,583
SCOTTIE: No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling
thing. It just means I can't climb
steep stairs or go to high places,
like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark.
But --

103
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,583
SCOTTIE(Shrugs and smiles): -- there are plenty of street-level
bars In this town.

104
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,375
ELSTER: Would you like a drink now?

105
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,666
SCOTTIE: No... no, thanks. A bit early in the
day for spirits.

106
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:21,250
SCOTTIE(Pause): Well, I guess that about covers
everything, doesn't it? I never
married; I don't see much of the
"old college gang"; I'm a retired
detective -- and you're in the
shipbuilding business.

107
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,750
SCOTTIE(Pause)(Pause): What's on your mind, Gavin?

108
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:34,625
ELSTER: I asked you to come up here, Scottie,
knowing that you had quit detective
works, but I wondered whether you
would go back on the job -- as a
special favor to me.

109
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,708
ELSTER: I want you to follow my wife.

110
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,083
ELSTER: Not what you think. We're very happily
married.

111
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:43,375
SCOTTIE: Then?

112
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,750
ELSTER: I'm afraid some harm may come to
her.

113
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,333
SCOTTIE: From whom?

114
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:46,916
ELSTER: Someone dead.

115
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:55,208
ELSTER: Scottie, do you believe that someone
out of the past, someone dead, can
enter and take possession of a living
being?

116
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:55,500
SCOTTIE: No.

117
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,291
ELSTER: If I told you I believe that his
happened to my wife, what would you
say?

118
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:07,166
SCOTTIE: I'd say you'd better take her to the
nearest psychiatrist, psychologist,
neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain
family doctor. And have him check
you both.

119
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:12,833
ELSTER(Defeated): Then you're of no use to me. I'm
sorry I wasted your time. Thank you
for coming in, Scottie.

120
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,916
SCOTTIE: I didn't mean to be that rough.

121
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:23,791
ELSTER: No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And
you're still the hard-headed Scot,
aren't you? Always were. Do you think
I'm making it up?

122
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,083
SCOTTIE: No.

123
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:48,958
ELSTER: I'm not making it up. I wouldn't
know how. She'll be talking to me
about something, nothing at all, and
suddenly the words fade into silence
and a cloud comes into her eyes and
they go blank... and she is somewhere
else, away from me... someone I don't
know. I call to her and she doesn't
hear. And then with a long sigh she
is back, and looks at me brightly,
and doesn't know she's been away...
can't tell me where... or why...

124
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,458
SCOTTIE: How often does this happen?

125
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:56,750
ELSTER: More and more in the past few weeks.
And she wanders. God knows where she
wanders. I followed her one day.

126
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,625
SCOTTIE: Where'd she go?

127
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:09,791
ELSTER: Watched her come out of the apartment,
someone I didn't know... walking in
a different way... holding her head
in a way I didn't know; and get into
her car, and drive out to...

128
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:34,083
ELSTER(He smiles grimly): Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She
sat on a bench at the edge of the
lake and stared across the water to
the old pillars that stand an the
far shore, the Portals of the Past.
Sat there a long time, not moving...
and I had to leave, to got to the
office. That evening, when I came
home, I asked what she'd done all
day. She said she'd driven to Golden
Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's
all.

129
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:34,375
SCOTTIE: Well?

130
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:39,458
ELSTER: The speedometer of her car showed
she had driven 94 miles that day.
Where did she go?

131
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:44,833
ELSTER(Pause): I have to know, Scottie. Where she
goes and what she does, before I got
involved with doctors.

132
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,208
SCOTTIE: Have you talked to the doctors at
all?

133
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:52,000
ELSTER: Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know
more before committing her to that
kind of care.

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,583
ELSTER(Anxiously): Scottie --

135
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:58,250
SCOTTIE(Quickly): I can get you a firm of private eyes
to follow her for you. They're
dependable, good boys --

136
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,125
ELSTER(Breaking in): I want you.

137
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,291
SCOTTIE: It's not my line.

138
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:04,791
ELSTER: Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I
can trust! I'm in a panic about this!

139
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,166
SCOTTIE: How can I see her, to know her?

140
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:14,250
ELSTER: We're going to an opening at the
opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's
first.  Which is easier?

141
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,541
SCOTTIE: Ernie's.

142
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,125
ELSTER: All right.

143
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:24,416
ELSTER(Pause): You won't know what to look for at
first, Scottie. Even I, who know her
so well, cannot tell, sometimes,
when the change has begun. She looks
so lovely and normal...

144
00:10:37,416 --> 00:11:41,000
ELSTER'S VOICE: But I realize now that the deep change
began on the first day I brought her
to San Francisco. You know what San
Francisco does to people who have
never seen it before. All of it
happened to Madeleine, but with such
an intensity as to be almost
frightening. She was like a child
came home. Everything about the city
excited her: she had to walk all the
hills, explore the edge of the ocean,
see all the old houses and wander
the old streets: and when she came
upon something unchanged, something
that was as it had been, her delight
was so strong so fiercely possessive!
These things were hers. And yet she
had never been here before. She had
been born and raised in the East. I
liked it at first, of course. I love
this place; I wanted my bride to
love it.  But then it began to make
me uneasy.  Her delight was too
strong; her excitement was too
intense, it never faded; her laugh
was too loud, her eyes sparkled too
brightly; there was something feverish
about the way she embraced the city.
She possessed it.  And then one day
she changed again...  and a great
sigh settled on her, and the cloud
came into her eyes...

145
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:01,875
ELSTER'S VOICE: I don't know what happened that day:
where she went, what she saw, what
she did. But on that day, the search
was ended. She had found what she
was looking for, she had come home.
And something in the city possessed
her.

146
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,166
SCOTTIE(Nodding in the: direction of the
gallery)
Who is the woman in the portrait?

147
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,250
SCOTTIE: The one where the lady is sitting.

148
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,416
ATTENDANT: Oh, that's Carlotta, sir.

149
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,083
ATTENDANT(At Scottie's reaction): You'll find it in the catalogue:
"Portrait of Carlotta."

150
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:45,375
MANAGERESS: Yes?

151
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,750
MANAGERESS: Is there something I can do for you?

152
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,250
SCOTTIE: Yes... you run this hotel.

153
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:52,833
MANAGERESS: Oh, yes!

154
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:57,916
SCOTTIE: Would you tell me, who has the room
on the second floor in the corner,
that corner?

155
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:13,500
MANAGERESS(Brightly): Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out
information of that sort. Our clients
are entitled to their privacy, you
know. And I do believe it's against
the law! Of course, I don't think
any of them would mind, really, but
still I would have to know who you
are, and ask --

156
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,583
MANAGERESS: Oh, dear! Has she done something
wrong?

157
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,750
SCOTTIE: Please answer my question.

158
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,041
MANAGERESS: I can't imagine that sweet girl with
that dear face --

159
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,208
SCOTTIE(Urgently): What is her name?

160
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,083
MANAGERESS: Valdes. Miss Valdes.

161
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,250
MANAGERESS(Pause. Then, brightly): It's Spanish, you know.

162
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,833
SCOTTIE(Slowly): Carlotta Valdes?

163
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,833
MANAGERESS: Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't
it?  Foreign. But sweet.

164
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,916
SCOTTIE(Holding in): How long has she had the room?

165
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,208
MANAGERESS: Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the
rent's due tomorrow.

166
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,708
SCOTTIE: Does she sleep here? Ever?

167
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:46,291
MANAGERESS: No... she only comes to sit. Two or
three times a week. And I never ask
questions, you know. As long as
they're well behaved. I must say
that I've wondered --

168
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,291
SCOTTIE(Cutting her off): When she comes down, don't say that
I've been here.

169
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,875
MANAGERESS(Brightly): Oh, but she hasn't been here today.
Scottie whirls back on her.

170
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,250
SCOTTIE: I saw her come in five minutes. ago.

171
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:06,250
MANAGERESS: Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all!
I would have seen her, you know.
I've been right here all the time,
putting olive oil on my rubber plant
leaves!

172
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,541
MANAGERESS: And there! There you see? Her key is
on the rack!

173
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,333
SCOTTIE(Heavily): Would you please go and look?

174
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,833
MANAGERESS: In her room? Well, yes, of course if
you ask. But it does seem silly...

175
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,833
MANAGERESS (O.S.)(Brightly): Oh, Mr. Detective! Would you like to
come and look?

176
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,000
SCOTTIE: Her car is gone.

177
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,583
MANAGERESS: What car?

178
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:55,166
SCOTTIE: Midge, who do you know that's an
authority an San Francisco history?

179
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:04,958
MIDGE: Now, that's the kind of greeting a
girl likes.  None of this "hello you
look wonderful" stuff. Just a good
straight "who do you know" --

180
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,041
SCOTTIE(breaking in): Well, who? Come on, you know
everybody.

181
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,541
MIDGE: Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.

182
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,708
SCOTTIE: Not that kind of history. The small
stuff! About people you never heard
of!

183
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:19,875
MIDGE: Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days
of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy
stories? Like who shot who in the
Embarcadero August, 1879?

184
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,166
SCOTTIE: Yeah.

185
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:20,750
MIDGE: Pop Leibel.

186
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,041
SCOTTIE: Who?

187
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,916
MIDGE: Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop.
What do you want to know?

188
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,583
SCOTTIE: Who shot who in the Embarcadero in
August, 1879.

189
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:33,166
MIDGE: Wait a minute! You're not a detective
any more. What's going on?

190
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,666
SCOTTIE(Pausing): Do you know him well?

191
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,541
MIDGE: Pop Leibel? Sure.

192
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,541
SCOTTIE: All right, come on. Introduce me.
Where is your hat?

193
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,208
MIDGE(Speeding to the door): I don't need a hat. Johnny, what's
it about?

194
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,291
SCOTTIE: I'll tell you later. Wait a minute!

195
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,375
POP LEIBEL: Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the
Sad Carlotta...

196
00:20:56,375 --> 00:21:02,375
SCOTTIE: What does a big old wooden house on
the corner of Eddy and Gough Street
have to do with her?

197
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,666
POP LEIBEL: It was hers. It was built for her.
Many years ago.

198
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,250
SCOTTIE: By whom?

199
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:32,625
POP LEIBEL: By... no... the name I do not
remember. A rich man, a powerful
man.  It is not an unusual story.
She came from somewhere small, to
the south of the city... some say
from a mission settlement... young,
yes; very young.  And she was found
singing and dancing in a cabaret by
the man... wait... wait... Ives!
His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took
her and built for her this great
house in the Western Addition... and
there was a child. Yes. This was it.
The child.

200
00:21:35,625 --> 00:22:05,291
POP LEIBEL: And now, fragments, you understand.
I cannot tell you how much time
passed, or how much happiness there
was. But then he threw her away. He
had no other children; his wife had
no children. He kept the child and
threw her away. Men could do that in
those days. They had the power...
and the freedom. And she became the
Sad Carlotta. Alone in the great
house... walking the streets alone,
her clothes becoming old and patched
and dirty... the Mad Carlotta...
stopping people in the streets to
ask, "Where is my child?... have you
seen my child?".

201
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,166
MIDGE: The poor thing....

202
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,041
SCOTTIE: And she died...

203
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:11,625
POP LEIBEL: She died.

204
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:11,916
SCOTTIE: How?

205
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,083
POP LEIBEL: By her own hand.

206
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,875
POP LEIBEL(Pause. Smiles as: sadly)
There are many such stories.

207
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,250
SCOTTIE: Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you
very much.

208
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,750
MIDGE: Hey, wait a minute! So long, Pop!
Thanks a lot!  She dashes out after
Scottie.

209
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,250
MIDGE: Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.

210
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:27,833
SCOTTIE: For what?

211
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,916
MIDGE: For bringing you here. Come on, tell!

212
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:30,791
SCOTTIE: Nothing to tell.

213
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:34,083
MIDGE: You'll tell, or you'll be back in
that corset! Come on!

214
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,250
SCOTTIE: I'll take you home.

215
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,125
SCOTTIE: Here you are.

216
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,625
MIDGE: You haven't told me everything.

217
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,791
SCOTTIE: I've told you enough.

218
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,583
MIDGE: Who's the guy, who's the wife?

219
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,375
SCOTTIE: Out. I've got things to do.

220
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,666
MIDGE: I know. The one who phoned. Your old
college chum, Elster.

221
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:52,958
SCOTTIE: Out!

222
00:22:52,958 --> 00:23:00,458
MIDGE: And the idea is that the Beautiful
Mad Carlotta has come back from the
dead, to take possession of Elster's
wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!

223
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:04,333
SCOTTIE(Angrily): I'm not telling you what I think!
I'm telling you what he thinks!

224
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,125
MIDGE: Think?  Well, what do you think?

225
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:11,000
MIDGE: Is she pretty?

226
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,291
SCOTTIE: Carlotta?

227
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,791
MIDGE(Evenly): No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.

228
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,958
SCOTTIE: Mmm, yeah, I guess...

229
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,958
MIDGE(Wickedly): I think I'll go take a look at that
portrait.

230
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:19,250
MIDGE(Wickedly)(With a bright smile): Bye!

231
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:21,541
SCOTTIE(Outraged): Midge!

232
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:21,833
MIDGE: Bye-bye!

233
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,500
ELSTER(With a wan smile): You've done well, Scottie. You're
good at your job.

234
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,375
SCOTTIE: That's Carlotta Valdes.

235
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:40,666
ELSTER: Yes.

236
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,750
SCOTTIE: There are things you didn't tell me.

237
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,750
ELSTER: I didn't know where she was going to
lead you.

238
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,250
SCOTTIE: But you knew about this.

239
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,250
ELSTER: Oh, yes. You noticed the way she
does her hair.

240
00:23:53,250 --> 00:24:12,125
ELSTER: Something else. My wife, Madeleine,
has several pieces of jewelry that
belonged to Carlotta. She inherited
them. Never wore them, they were too
old-fashioned... until now. Now,
when she is alone, she gets them out
and looks at them handles them gently,
curiously... puts them on and stares
at herself in the mirror... and goes
into that other world... is someone
else again.

241
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,208
SCOTTIE: Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's
grandmother?

242
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:20,500
ELSTER: Great-grandmother. The child who was
taken from her whose loss drove
Carlotta mad and to her death - was
Madeleine's grandmother.

243
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,583
SCOTTIE(Confidently): Well, that explains it. Anyone could
develop an obsession for the past,
with a background like that.

244
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,666
ELSTER: But she doesn't know, about her
background.

245
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,750
ELSTER(As Scottie stares,: narrowly)
She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.

246
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:37,833
SCOTTIE: Knows nothing of a grave out at
Mission Dolores, or an old house an
Eddy Street, or a portrait at the
Palace of the Legion of Honor?

247
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:38,125
ELSTER: Nothing.

248
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,208
SCOTTIE: And when she goes to those places...

249
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,708
ELSTER: She is not my wife.

250
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:46,708
SCOTTIE: How do you know all these things she
doesn't know?

251
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:52,083
ELSTER: Her mother told me most of then before
she died. I dug out the rest for
myself, here.

252
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,166
SCOTTIE: Why did she never tell her daughter?

253
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:59,250
ELSTER: Natural fear. Her grandmother went
insane and took her own life. And
the blood is in Madeleine.

254
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,625
ELSTER(Pause): Scottie, I ask you to watch her
closely.

255
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:38,791
SCOTTIE(whispering): Are you all right?

256
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:41,083
SCOTTIE(Calling softly): Madeleine...

257
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,250
MADELEINE(Faintly, distantly): Please... thank you... please...

258
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,916
MADELEINE(Appealingly): Where is my child?... have you seen
my child...?

259
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:12,208
SCOTTIE: Yes?... No, it's all right; I'll
call you back. Yes. Yes!

260
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,375
SCOTTIE: Are you all right?

261
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,541
SCOTTIE: Oh... you'll want this...

262
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:29,333
MADELEINE: Why am I here? What happened?

263
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:29,625
SCOTTIE: You...

264
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,000
SCOTTIE(Then, not liking the: sound of the truth)
...fell into the Bay.

265
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,083
SCOTTIE: I dried your hair as well as I could.
But you'd better come here by the
fire.

266
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:46,375
SCOTTIE: They're almost at dry. Here. Why
don't you come over here?

267
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,875
SCOTTIE: Would you like some coffee?

268
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:57,166
SCOTTIE: You'd better have some. Or would you
rather have a drink?

269
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,333
MADELEINE(Wonderingly): ...fell into the bay...

270
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,833
MADELEINE: ...and you fished me out...

271
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:09,416
MADELEINE: Thank you.

272
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,291
SCOTTIE: You don't remember.

273
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:12,583
MADELEINE: No...

274
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:14,375
SCOTTIE: Do you remember where you were?

275
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:19,458
MADELEINE(Childishly surprised): Oh, of course I remember that!  But
then I must have had a dizzy spell,
and fainted!

276
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,333
SCOTTIE(Quickly): Where were you?

277
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:20,625
MADELEINE: At...

278
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:27,125
MADELEINE(Triumphantly): ...Old Port Point!  Out at the
Presidio! Of course I remember! I
often go there!

279
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:27,416
SCOTTIE: Why?

280
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:30,708
MADELEINE(Almost naively): Because I love it so. It's beautiful
there. Especially at sunset.

281
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:34,000
MADELEINE(Almost naively)(She leans her head: back sensually to
the warmth)
Ah... thank you for the fire.

282
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,500
SCOTTIE: Where had you been before?

283
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:35,791
MADELEINE: When?

284
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:36,375
SCOTTIE: This afternoon.

285
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,250
MADELEINE: Oh... wandering about.

286
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,041
SCOTTIE: Before?  Where?  Where had you been?

287
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:40,625
MADELEINE(Positively): Downtown, shopping.

288
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:43,791
SCOTTIE: Please drink your coffee.

289
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:46,166
MADELEINE: I will. You're terribly direct in
your questions.

290
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:48,541
SCOTTIE: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

291
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:52,416
MADELEINE: You're not. Merely direct. What were
you doing there? At Old Fort Point?

292
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:53,000
SCOTTIE: Wandering about.

293
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,166
MADELEINE: You like it, too.

294
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,541
MADELEINE(Then with a wicked: smile)
And where had you been?... just
before?

295
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,541
SCOTTIE: The Palace of the Legion of honor.
The Art Gallery.

296
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:10,916
MADELEINE(Enthusiastically): Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it?
I've never been inside. But it looks
so lovely, driving past.

297
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:19,708
MADELEINE(Softly): Lucky for me you were wandering about.
Thank you again. I've been terrible
bother to you.

298
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:20,000
SCOTTIE: No.

299
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,583
MADELEINE: When you...

300
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:26,166
MADELEINE(And suddenly conscious: of her nakedness
again, and embarrassed)
There were pins in my hair...

301
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:27,041
SCOTTIE: Oh! Yes! Here!

302
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:29,625
MADELEINE: Thank you.

303
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:36,000
MADELEINE: You shouldn't have brought me here,
you know.

304
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,791
SCOTTIE: I... didn't know where you lived.

305
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:42,583
MADELEINE: You could have looked in my car. Oh,
but you didn't know my car, did you?

306
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:49,458
SCOTTIE: Yes, I knew which one it was. It's
out there, now. But I didn't think
you'd want to be brought home that
way.

307
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:50,625
MADELEINE: No, you are right,

308
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:55,125
MADELEINE(Pause, as she works): I'm glad you didn't take me home...
I wouldn't have known you, to thank
you...

309
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:59,916
MADELEINE(Pause, as she works)(Suddenly appalled): Oh, but I don't know you! And you
don't know me! My name is Madeleine
Elster.

310
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:01,416
SCOTTIE: My name is John Ferguson.

311
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:05,291
MADELEINE: That's a good, strong name. Do your
friends call you John? Or Jack.

312
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,375
SCOTTIE: John. Old friends. Acquaintances
call me Scottie.

313
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:09,166
MADELEINE(Smiling): I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.

314
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:15,458
SCOTTIE(Grinning): No, I wouldn't like that. And after
what happened today I should think
you could call me Scottie. Or even
John.

315
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,250
MADELEINE: I prefer John. There, that's done.

316
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,041
MADELEINE(The hair is in order): And what do you do, John?

317
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:19,625
SCOTTIE: Wander about.

318
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:22,000
MADELEINE: That's a good occupation. And live
here... alone?

319
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,166
MADELEINE(softly): One shouldn't live alone.

320
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:28,333
SCOTTIE: Some people prefer it.

321
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,208
MADELEINE: No... it's wrong.

322
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:32,375
MADELEINE(Simply): I'm married, you know.

323
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,958
SCOTTIE: Will you tell me something? Has this
ever happened to you before?

324
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:39,250
MADELEINE(startled): What?

325
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,750
SCOTTIE: ...Falling... into San Francisco
Bay?

326
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:55,625
MADELEINE: No, never before. I've fallen into
lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a
little girl. And I fell into a river,
once, trying to leap from one stone
to another. But I've never fallen
into San Francisco Bay. Have you?
Ever before?

327
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:58,291
SCOTTIE(Grinning): No... this is the first time for me,
too.

328
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,666
SCOTTIE: Here, let me give you a lit --

329
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:07,958
SCOTTIE: Hello.

330
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:10,041
ELSTER'S VOICE: Scottie, what happened? She's not
home, yet.

331
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:13,916
SCOTTIE: No, she's all right. She's still
here. But I'll get her home soon.

332
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:14,500
ELSTER'S VOICE: What happened?

333
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,000
SCOTTIE: She... went into the Bay.

334
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,291
SCOTTIE: Hello?

335
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:19,458
ELSTER'S VOICE: Did she hurt herself?

336
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:26,041
SCOTTIE: No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to
worry about. But she doesn't know.
You understand that. She doesn't
know what she did.

337
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:31,625
ELSTER'S VOICE: Scottie... Madeleine is twenty-six.
Carlotta Valdes committed suicide
when she was twenty-six.

338
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:57,916
MIDGE(Softly): Well, now, Johnny-O... Was it a
ghost?... And was it fun?...

339
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:00,208
MIDGE: Oops!

340
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,375
SCOTTIE: Is that for me?

341
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,250
MADELEINE: Oh! Yes. Hello.

342
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,416
SCOTTIE: Good morning. I worried about you,
last night. You shouldn't have run
like that.

343
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,208
MADELEINE(Embarrassed): I... suddenly felt such a fool.

344
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,208
SCOTTIE: I wanted to drive you home. Are you
all right?

345
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,000
MADELEINE(Flashing a smile): Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.

346
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,291
MADELEINE(Flashing a smile)(Then, ruefully): But as I remember now, that water
was cold, wasn't it?

347
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:07,875
MADELEINE(Flashing a smile)(Then, ruefully)(He nods. She looks: away)
What a terrible thing to do... and
you were so kind...

348
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:10,875
MADELEINE(Flashing a smile)(Then, ruefully)(He nods. She looks(With a gesture): It's a formal thank-you letter. And
a great big apology.

349
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,375
SCOTTIE: You've nothing to apologize for.

350
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:15,958
MADELEINE: Oh, yes! The whole thing must have
been so embarrassing for you!

351
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,750
SCOTTIE: Not at all, I enjoyed --

352
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,916
SCOTTIE: -- talking to you...

353
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,708
MADELEINE(With small, contained: amusement)
I enjoyed talking to you.

354
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:26,875
SCOTTIE: I'll get my mail...

355
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,375
SCOTTIE: Would you like some coffee?

356
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,541
MADELEINE(Quickly): No! No, thank you!

357
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:43,041
MADELEINE: I couldn't mail it; I didn't know
your address. But I had a landmark.
I remembered Coit Tower and it led
me straight to you.

358
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,708
SCOTTIE: The first time I've been grateful
for Coit Tower.

359
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:50,208
SCOTTIE: I hope we will, too.

360
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:50,500
MADELEINE: What?

361
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,375
SCOTTIE: Meet again, sometime.

362
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:51,958
MADELEINE: We have.

363
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:54,250
MADELEINE: Good-bye.

364
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:54,541
SCOTTIE: Good-bye.

365
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:57,708
SCOTTIE(Suddenly walking): Where are you going?

366
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:01,583
MADELEINE: I don't know.

367
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:01,875
SCOTTIE: Shopping?

368
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:02,166
MADELEINE: No.

369
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,333
SCOTTIE: Well... anywhere in particular?

370
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,125
MADELEINE: No, I Just thought I'd wander.

371
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:05,416
SCOTTIE: Ah.

372
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:07,500
SCOTTIE(Then): That's what I was going to do.

373
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,166
MADELEINE: Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your
occupation, isn't it?

374
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:16,333
SCOTTIE: Don't you think it's sort of a waste
for the two of us to...

375
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:20,833
MADELEINE: Wander separately? Ah, but only one
is a wanderer. Two, together, are
always going somewhere.

376
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:23,208
SCOTTIE: No... no, I don't think that's
necessarily true.

377
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:26,708
MADELEINE(With a smiling nod): You left your door open.

378
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:30,291
SCOTTIE: Don't move!

379
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:42,083
SCOTTIE(Finally): Do you know where you're going?

380
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,875
MADELEINE: Of course not! I'm a wanderer!

381
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,250
MADELEINE(Pause. Then brightly): I'd like to go somewhere I've never
been!

382
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,750
SCOTTIE: How can you be sure?

383
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,250
MADELEINE: If I've been there? That's silly!
Either you've been to a place or you
haven't.

384
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:07,833
MADELEINE: How old?

385
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,916
SCOTTIE: Oh... some, two thousand years, or
more.

386
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,083
MADELEINE: The oldest living things?

387
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,583
SCOTTIE: You've never been here before.

388
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,750
SCOTTIE: What are you thinking?

389
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:22,833
MADELEINE(Searching): Of all the people who have been
born... and have died... while the
trees went on living.

390
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:25,833
SCOTTIE(Agreeing): Their true name is Sequoia
Sempervirens: always green, ever-
living.

391
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,000
MADELEINE(Flatly): I don't like them.

392
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,291
SCOTTIE: Why?

393
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,791
MADELEINE(Simply): Knowing I have to die...

394
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:34,458
MADELEINE: But I like the stream! It's a lovely
stream!

395
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,250
MADELEINE: But it makes no sound! Listen!

396
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,416
MADELEINE: Do you hear anything?

397
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:44,208
SCOTTIE(Shaking his head): Only silence. It's always like this.

398
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,375
MADELEINE(Wondering): And no birds sing.

399
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:46,541
SCOTTIE: No birds live here.

400
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:46,833
MADELEINE: No.

401
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:51,916
SCOTTIE: Would you like a drink of water?

402
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:52,791
MADELEINE: No, thank you.

403
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:10,375
MADELEINE: Somewhere in here I was born... and
here I died and it was only a moment
for you... you took no notice...

404
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:10,666
SCOTTIE(Almost sharply): Madeleine!

405
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:37,958
SCOTTIE(Gently): Madeleine...

406
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:42,125
SCOTTIE: Where are you now?

407
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,000
MADELEINE(Softly, distantly): Here with you.

408
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,291
SCOTTIE: Where?

409
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:44,166
MADELEINE: The tall trees...

410
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,666
SCOTTIE: Have you been here before?

411
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:45,958
MADELEINE: Yes...

412
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:46,250
SCOTTIE: When?

413
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,416
SCOTTIE: Where were you born?

414
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,000
MADELEINE: Long ago...

415
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,291
SCOTTIE: Where?

416
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:52,583
SCOTTIE: When?

417
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:56,166
SCOTTIE: Tell me.

418
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,041
SCOTTIE: Madeleine! Tell me!

419
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:00,625
MADELEINE: No!... No!

420
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:04,500
SCOTTIE(Low and urgent): Tell me what it is. Where do you go?
What takes you away?

421
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,666
MADELEINE: No, don't ask me!

422
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:13,041
SCOTTIE: When you jumped in the bay, you didn't
know where you were. You guessed but
you didn't know.

423
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:16,041
MADELEINE: I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I
fell!

424
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:17,208
SCOTTIE: Why did you jump?

425
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:17,500
MADELEINE: No!

426
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,166
SCOTTIE: What was it inside that told you to
jump?

427
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:23,666
MADELEINE: No, I can't tell you!

428
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:23,958
SCOTTIE: What?!

429
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,625
MADELEINE(Strongly): No! Please! Please, please, please,
please, don't ask me!

430
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,125
MADELEINE(Softly, tired): Take me away from here?

431
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:30,416
SCOTTIE: Home?

432
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,583
MADELEINE: ...somewhere in the light.

433
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:37,875
MADELEINE: And promise you won't ask me again.
Please promise me that.

434
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:52,041
MADELEINE: Why did you run?

435
00:37:54,041 --> 00:38:03,625
SCOTTIE(Finally, quietly): I'm responsible for you now, you
know.  The Chinese say that once you
have saved someone's life, you are
responsible for it forever. And so
I'm committed. And I have to know.

436
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:06,291
MADELEINE: And you'll go on saving me? Again
and again?

437
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:36,875
MADELEINE: There is so little I know. It is as
though I were walking down a long
corridor that once was mirrored, and
fragments of mirror still hang there,
dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark
image of me... and yet not me...
someone else, in other clothes, of
another time, doing things I have
never done... but still me... And I
can't stop to ask why, I must keep
on walking. At the and of the corridor
there is nothing but darkness, and I
know when I walk into the darkness,
I'll die.

438
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:41,375
MADELEINE(Pause; she looks up): But I've never come to the and; I've
always come back, before then. Except
once.

439
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:41,666
SCOTTIE: Yesterday.

440
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:48,458
SCOTTIE: And you didn't know. You didn't know
what happened. Until you found
yourself there with me.

441
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,250
SCOTTIE: You don't know where you were.

442
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,833
SCOTTIE: But the small scenes, the fragments
in the mirror: you remember them.

443
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:58,125
MADELEINE: Vaguely...

444
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,291
SCOTTIE: What do you remember?

445
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:03,166
MADELEINE(Searching): A room... there is a room, and I sit
there alone... always alone...

446
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,666
SCOTTIE: Would you know the room?

447
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:05,833
MADELEINE: No... it's in shadow.

448
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:06,416
SCOTTIE: What else?

449
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:07,000
MADELEINE: A grave...

450
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,291
SCOTTIE: Where?

451
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:12,958
MADELEINE: I don't know. An open grave. I stand
by the gravestone looking down into
it. And it's my grave.

452
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,125
SCOTTIE: How do you know?

453
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:14,708
MADELEINE: I know.

454
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,500
SCOTTIE: There's a name on the gravestone.

455
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,583
MADELEINE: No. It's new and clean, and waiting.

456
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:19,458
SCOTTIE(Beginning to feel: lost)
What else?

457
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:30,250
MADELEINE(Searching): This part is dream, I think. There
is a tower and a bell and... a garden
below... but it seems to be in
Spain... a village in Spain. And
then it clicks off, and is gone.

458
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,625
SCOTTIE: A portrait? Do you ever see a
portrait?

459
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:32,916
MADELEINE: No.

460
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:37,083
SCOTTIE: Of the woman in the mirror. Would
you know her if you saw her?

461
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,166
MADELEINE: But I'm the woman in the mirror!

462
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:39,458
SCOTTIE(Desperately): No!

463
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:46,041
SCOTTIE(To himself): If I could find the key... find the
beginning put it together...

464
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:53,208
MADELEINE(Quietly, lost): And so explain it away?  But there
is a way to explain it, you see. If
I'm mad? That would explain it,
wouldn't it?

465
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:55,500
SCOTTIE: Madeleine!!

466
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:07,375
MADELEINE(Muffled, against his: breast)
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't
want to die, but there's someone
inside me, there's a somebody else,
and she says I must die... Scottie,
don't let me go!

467
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,875
SCOTTIE: I'm here, I've got you...

468
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:09,750
MADELEINE: I'm so afraid...

469
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,250
MADELEINE(She looks up): ...you won't let it happen...

470
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,041
MADELEINE(Whispering): Don't leave me... stay with me...

471
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:17,916
SCOTTIE: All the time.

472
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:32,208
SCOTTIE(Calling): Midge?

473
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:36,291
MIDGE: Hi, Johnny! Did you get my message?

474
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:44,166
SCOTTIE: I did. Since when do you go about
slipping notes under men's doors?

475
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:53,458
MIDGE: Since I stopped being able to get
them on the phone. For a man who has
nothing to do, you're certainly a
busy little bee. Where do you go,
these days?

476
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:54,041
SCOTTIE: Just wander.

477
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:54,333
MIDGE: Where?

478
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:54,625
SCOTTIE: Around.

479
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:54,916
MIDGE: Oh?

480
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:58,500
SCOTTIE: Mm. Better.

481
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,666
MIDGE: Did you need it?

482
00:40:59,666 --> 00:40:59,958
SCOTTIE: Yeah.

483
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:00,250
MIDGE: Oh?

484
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,625
SCOTTIE: What was this desperate urge to see
me?

485
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:10,416
MIDGE: All I said in the note was: "Where
are you?" That doesn't sound desperate
to me.

486
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:11,916
SCOTTIE: Well, I detected an undercurrent.

487
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:19,083
MIDGE: I just thought if I gave you a drink
and fed you some dinner, you'd be so
grateful you'd take me to a movie.

488
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,458
SCOTTIE: Fair enough. What'll we talk about
at dinner?

489
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:22,625
MIDGE: Oh... this and that.

490
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:23,791
SCOTTIE: What I've been doing?

491
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:28,583
MIDGE: If you want to. Naturally, we won't
talk about anything you don't want
to talk about.

492
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:28,875
SCOTTIE: Naturally.

493
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,375
MIDGE(Innocently): What have you been doing?

494
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:32,666
SCOTTIE(With small grin): Wandering.

495
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,166
SCOTTIE: What have you been doing?

496
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:43,333
MIDGE: Oh, I'm having a wonderful time!
I've gone back to my first love...
painting.

497
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:47,208
SCOTTIE: Good. I've always said you were
wasting your time in the underwear
department.

498
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:49,875
MIDGE: Well, it's a living. But I'm excited
about this.

499
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,666
SCOTTIE: What is it, a still life?

500
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:53,458
MIDGE: No, not exactly. Want to see?

501
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:59,333
MIDGE: As a matter of fact, I thought I
might give it to you.

502
00:41:59,333 --> 00:41:59,625
SCOTTIE(smiling, surprised): Oh?

503
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:13,500
SCOTTIE(Softly): Not funny, Midge.

504
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:17,791
MIDGE: Johnny!

505
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:22,875
MIDGE: But Johnny, I thought you would --

506
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:28,250
SCOTTIE(Nicely): We'll make that movie some other
night, huh?

507
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:30,833
MIDGE(Desperately apologetic): But Johnny...!!!

508
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:34,416
MIDGE: Ah, no!!

509
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:36,916
MIDGE: Oh! Marjorie Wood!! You fool!!

510
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:40,208
MIDGE(At the portrait): OH!!!!!

511
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:07,208
SCOTTIE: What's the matter?... What time is
it?... Madeleine, what's happened?

512
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:13,083
MADELEINE(Barely): I should have phoned... but I wanted
to see you... be with you...

513
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:13,958
SCOTTIE: Why? What's happened?

514
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,625
MADELEINE: I had the dream. The dream came back
again...

515
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:21,916
SCOTTIE: It's all right. You're all right,
I'll get you some brandy.

516
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:25,083
MADELEINE(Sharply): No, don't go away!

517
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:25,958
SCOTTIE: Only this far.

518
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:29,458
SCOTTIE: Here. Straight down, it's medicine.

519
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:32,333
SCOTTIE: Where's your husband?

520
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:35,333
MADELEINE: I didn't wake him. I don't want him
to know...

521
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:40,000
SCOTTIE: Here, now, it's going to be all right.
Here.

522
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,166
SCOTTIE: It was a dream, you're awake, you're
all right, now. Can you tell me?

523
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:51,041
MADELEINE: It was the tower again... and the
bell, and the old Spanish village...

524
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:51,625
SCOTTIE: Yes --

525
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:55,208
MADELEINE: But clear... so very clear... for
the first time... all of it...

526
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:55,791
SCOTTIE: Tell me.

527
00:43:55,791 --> 00:44:11,083
MADELEINE: There was a village square, a green
with trees... and an old whitewashed
Spanish church with a cloister.
Across the green: a big, grey, wooden
house with a porch and shutters and
a balcony above... a small garden,
and next to it, a livery stable...
with old carriages lined up inside.

528
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:13,666
SCOTTIE: Go on.

529
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:19,958
MADELEINE: At the end of the green there was a
whitewashed stone house with a lovely
pepper tree at the corner --

530
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:25,958
SCOTTIE(Finishing it): -- and an old wooden hotel of the
old California days, and a saloon...
dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging
oil lamps.

531
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:26,833
MADELEINE: Yes?! But --

532
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,625
SCOTTIE(Gently): It's all there. It's no dream.

533
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,708
SCOTTIE: You've been there before. You've
seen it.

534
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:33,291
MADELEINE: No, never!

535
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:45,875
SCOTTIE: Madeleine, a hundred miles south of
San Francisco there's an old Spanish
Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista.
It's been preserved exactly as it
was a hundred years ago as a museum.
Now, think hard, darling. You've
been there before. You've seen it!

536
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:50,041
MADELEINE(Frightened): No, never! I've never been there!
Scottie, what is it? I've never been
there!

537
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:53,333
SCOTTIE(To himself): Carlotta...

538
00:44:56,333 --> 00:45:01,708
SCOTTIE: What was it he said?  She came from
somewhere south of the city... some
say a mission settlement...

539
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:04,583
SCOTTIE: Madeleine, think hard!!

540
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:11,875
SCOTTIE(Quietly): Go on with your dream. What was it
that frightened you?

541
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:23,541
MADELEINE: I stood alone on the green, searching
for something, and I started to walk
to the church. But then the darkness
closed in, I was alone in the dark,
being pulled into darkness, and I
fought to wake up...

542
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:42,708
SCOTTIE: You're going to be all right now,
Madeleine. I've got something to
work on now. I'm going to take you
there -- to the Mission -- this
afternoon. And when you see it, you'll
remember when you saw it before, and
that will finish your dream and
destroy it. I promise.  You'll be
free.

543
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:45,291
SCOTTIE: All right?

544
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:55,666
SCOTTIE: I'll take you home. If your husband
is awake, say you couldn't sleep and
went out for some air. And come back
to me about noon. Come along.

545
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:00,750
MADELEINE: No, I'll go alone. I'm all right.

546
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,125
EL CAMINO REAL: MISSION SAN JUAN BAUTISTA FOUNDED
JUNE 24, 1797

547
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:01,416
SCOTTIE: Madeleine...?

548
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:04,583
SCOTTIE: Where are you now?

549
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:07,458
MADELEINE(Softly): Here with you.

550
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,958
SCOTTIE: And it's a all real.

551
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:09,250
MADELEINE: Yes.

552
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:17,041
SCOTTIE(Firmly): Not merely as it was a hundred years
ago. As it was a year ago, or six
months ago, whenever you were here
to see it.

553
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:19,125
SCOTTIE(Firmly)(Pressing): Madeleine, think of when you were
here!

554
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:33,791
MADELEINE(Dreamily): There were not so many carriages,
then. And there were horses in the
stalls; a bay, two black, and a grey.
It was her favorite place, but we
were forbidden to play here, and
Sister Teresa would scold us...

555
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:37,666
SCOTTIE: Well, now, here!

556
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:49,333
SCOTTIE: Here's your grey horse!  Course he'd
have a tough time getting in and out
of a stall without being pushed, but
still... You see?  There's an answer
for everything!

557
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:52,916
SCOTTIE: Madeleine! Try!

558
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:01,083
SCOTTIE: Madeleine, try... for me...

559
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,875
SCOTTIE: My love... because I love you.

560
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:09,250
MADELEINE(Whispering): I love you too... too late... too
late...

561
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,125
SCOTTIE: No... we're together...

562
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:12,208
MADELEINE: Too late... there's something I must
do...

563
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:18,375
SCOTTIE(murmuring): Nothing you must do... no one
possesses you... you're safe with
me... my love...

564
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:20,958
MADELEINE: Too late...

565
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:40,333
SCOTTIE(Firmly): There are things I have to tell you,
about how we met, and why we are
together. But they can wait. The
only important thing now is that I
love you and I'm going to keep you
safe.

566
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:40,916
MADELEINE(Trembling): You can't.

567
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:41,208
SCOTTIE: Why?

568
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,083
MADELEINE: Let me go.

569
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:42,375
SCOTTIE: Where?

570
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,458
MADELEINE: To the church, I must go there.

571
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:45,041
SCOTTIE: Madeleine --

572
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:46,208
MADELEINE: Please let me go.

573
00:48:52,208 --> 00:49:03,291
SCOTTIE: Madeleine, don't fight me off, don't
put me away. You've been fighting
alone, and you're lost, but no more.
Hold on to me. Be sure of me, always.
And whatever it is, we'll lick it. I
promise.

574
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:17,375
MADELEINE(Head low, brokenly): It's not fair, it's too late. It
wasn't supposed to happen this way,
it shouldn't have happened...!

575
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:20,958
SCOTTIE: It had to. We're in love. That's all
that counts. Madeleine --

576
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,750
MADELEINE(Frantic, struggling): Let me go! Let me go!!

577
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,041
SCOTTIE(Holding her; sharply): Madeleine!!

578
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:28,833
MADELEINE: You believe that I love you?

579
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:29,125
SCOTTIE: Yes.

580
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:34,500
MADELEINE: And if you lose me, you'll know that
I loved you and wanted to go on loving
you.

581
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,666
SCOTTIE: I won't lose you.

582
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:39,750
MADELEINE: Let me go into the church alone.

583
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,041
SCOTTIE: Why?

584
00:49:40,041 --> 00:50:01,625
MADELEINE: Please. Because I love you.  He stares
at her, sees the pleading look in
her eyes, and lets go. She turns and
walks away toward the church, slowly,
her head bowed. He watches her go
and starts to move after her. Then
slowly, as she goes, her head begins
to go up until finally, as she walks,
she is staring high above her.  And
then, suddenly, she breaks into a
broken run.

585
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:11,916
SCOTTIE: Madeleine!!!

586
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:06,083
(NOTE: THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE FOLLOWING SPEECH COVERS: THE RISE AND ENTRANCE OF THE CAMERA AND BECOMES INTELLIGIBLE
ONLY AT ITS END.)

587
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:31,875
OFFICIAL: Mr. Elster, suspecting that all was
not well with his wife's mental state,
took the preliminary precaution of
having her watched by Mr. Ferguson
lest any harm befall her, and you
have heard that Mr. Elster was
prepared to take his wife to an
institution where her mental health
would have been in the hand of
qualified specialists.  And Mr.
Ferguson, being an ex-detective,
would have seemed the proper choice
for the role of watchdog and
protector. As you have learned, it
was an unfortunate choice.

588
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:54,666
OFFICIAL(pause): However, I think you will agree that
no blame can be attached to the
husband. His delay in putting his
wife under medical care was due only
to the need information as to her
behavior that he expected to get
from Mr. Ferguson. He had taken every
precaution to protect his wife. He
could not have anticipated that Mr.
Ferguson's "weakness" his "fear of
heights", called "acrophobia", would
make him powerless when he was most
needed.

589
00:51:54,666 --> 00:52:12,041
OFFICIAL(pause)(pause): As to Mr. Ferguson: you have heard
his former superior, Detective Captain
Hansen, from that great city to the
north, testify as to his character
and ability. Captain Hansen was most
enthusiastic. The fact that Mr.
Ferguson once before, under similar
circumstances, allowed a police
colleague to tall to his death,
Captain Hansen dismissed as an
"unfortunate Incident."

590
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:38,416
OFFICIAL: Of course Mr. Ferguson is to be
congratulated for having once saved
the woman's life when, in a previous
fit of aberration, she threw herself
into the Bay. It is a pity that
knowing her suicidal tendencies he
did not make a greater effort the
second time. But we are not here to
pass judgment on Mr. Ferguson's lack
of initiative. He did nothing, and
the law has little to say on the
subject of things left undone.

591
00:52:38,416 --> 00:53:09,916
OFFICIAL(pause): Nor does his strange behavior after
he saw the body fall have any bearing
on your verdict. He did not remain
at the scone of the death. He ran
away.  He claims he suffered a mental
blackout and knew nothing more until
he found himself back in his own
apartment in San Francisco several
hours later. You may accept that or
not. Or, you may believe that, having
once again allowed someone to die,
he could not face the tragic result
of his own weakness, and ran away.
That has nothing to do with your
verdict.  It is a matter between him
and his conscience.

592
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:24,291
OFFICIAL(pause)(pause): Now. From the evidence of the mind
of Madeleine Elster prior to her
death, from the manner of her death,
and from the Postmortem examination
of the body showing the actual cause
of her death, you should have no
difficulty in reaching your verdict.
Gentlemen, you may retire.

593
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,458
FOREMAN: We've reached the verdict.

594
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:29,958
OFFICIAL: And what is your verdict.

595
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:35,333
FOREMAN: We find that Madeleine Elster
committed suicide while being out of --
while being out of unsound mind.

596
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,416
OFFICIAL: Your verdict will be so recorded.
Dismissed.

597
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:44,291
HANSEN: Let's go, Scottie.

598
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:46,375
HANSEN(Glares over at the: Official grimly)
The son of a --

599
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:53,666
ELSTER: Do you mind if I speak to him for a
minute?

600
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:56,250
ELSTER: Scottie --

601
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:01,041
ELSTER: Scottie, I'm sorry. That was rough.

602
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:09,333
ELSTER: He had no right to say that. It was
my responsibility. You didn't know
her. I shouldn't have got you
involved.

603
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,500
SCOTTIE(struggling): I -- I --

604
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:23,666
ELSTER: No, there's nothing you have to say
to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For
good. I can't stay here. I'm winding
up her affairs, and mine. I'm going
to get as far away as I can. Probably
Europe. And I'll probably never come
back.

605
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:27,541
ELSTER(Extends his hand): Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything
I can do for you before I go...

606
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:36,333
ELSTER: There was no way for them to
understand. But you and I know who
killed Madeleine.

607
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:47,916
MIDGE(Brightly): It's Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus. I had
a long talk with the lady in musical
therapy, and she said Mozart's the
boy for you, Johnny. The broom that
sweeps the cobwebs away. That's what
the lady said. You know, it's
wonderful how they've got it all
taped now, John. They've got music
for melancholiacs, and music for
dipsomaniacs, and music for
nymphomaniacs... I wonder what would
happen if somebody mixed up their
files?

608
00:55:50,916 --> 00:55:57,208
MIDGE: But I brought you a lot of other
things. You can see what you like.
And the thing shuts off automatically.

609
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:02,500
MIDGE: Ah, Johnny, please try. Johnny, try!
You're not lost. Mother's here.

610
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,083
MIDGE: Time? Okay.

611
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:18,166
MIDGE: I'll be in again, John. Do you want
me to shut that off? It shuts off
automatically.

612
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:24,833
MIDGE(Softly): Ah, Johnny-O... you don't know I'm
here, do you?

613
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:27,708
MIDGE: But I'm here.

614
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:36,083
MIDGE: Could I see the doctor for a moment?

615
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:38,375
NURSE: Doctor...?

616
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:41,541
DOCTOR: Oh. Yes, Miss Wood?

617
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:49,041
MIDGE: Doctor, how long is it going to take
you to pull him out of this?

618
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:55,041
DOCTOR: It is hard to say. Six months, at
least. Perhaps a year. It depends to
a certain extent on him.

619
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:55,916
MIDGE: He won't talk.

620
00:56:55,916 --> 00:57:07,583
DOCTOR: No. We have ways of digging out
knowledge. But it takes longer. He
is suffering from acute melancholia,
together with a guilt complex. He
blames himself for what happened to
the woman. And we know little of the
background.

621
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:11,166
MIDGE: I can give you one thing: he was in
love with her.

622
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:12,666
DOCTOR: Ah? That complicates the problem.

623
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:15,041
MIDGE: I'll give you another complication:
he still is.

624
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:21,208
MIDGE: And you know something, Doctor?  I
don't think Mozart's going to help
at all.

625
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:08,000
SCOTTIE: Where did you get this car?!

626
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,500
THE WOMAN(Startled by his: vehemence)
I beg your pardon?

627
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,083
SCOTTIE: This car...!!

628
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:18,750
THE WOMAN: Oh!  Why... I bought it from a man
who used to live here, in this
apartment building. Mister Gavin
Elster. I bought it from him when he
moved away.

629
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:28,250
THE WOMAN: 0h! You know him! And his wife? The
poor thing. I didn't know her. Tell
me -- is it true that she really
believed --

630
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:43,833
SCOTTIE: I'm sorry.

631
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:18,000
JUDY: Well? What is it?

632
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,375
SCOTTIE: Could I ask you a couple of questions?

633
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:25,875
JUDY: What for? Who are you?

634
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:27,958
SCOTTIE: My name is John Ferguson, and --

635
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:30,625
JUDY: Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or
something?

636
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:34,791
SCOTTIE: No, there are just a few things I
want to ask you, and --

637
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:36,875
JUDY: Do you live here in the hotel?

638
00:59:36,875 --> 00:59:40,458
SCOTTIE: No, I happened to see you come in,
and I thought --

639
00:59:40,458 --> 00:59:49,125
JUDY: 0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well,
you've got a nerve, following me
right into the hotel and up to my
room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!

640
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:54,791
SCOTTIE: No, please! I Just want to talk to
you!

641
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,166
JUDY(Pushing on the door): Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!

642
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:59,833
SCOTTIE: I'm not going to hurt you! I promise!
Please!

643
01:60:01,833 --> 01:60:03,625
SCOTTIE: Just let me talk to you.

644
01:60:03,625 --> 01:60:04,208
JUDY(Hesitating): What about?

645
01:60:04,208 --> 01:60:04,500
SCOTTIE: You.

646
01:60:04,500 --> 01:60:04,791
JUDY: Why?

647
01:60:06,791 --> 01:60:08,583
SCOTTIE: Because you remind me of someone.

648
01:60:10,583 --> 01:60:23,166
JUDY: I've heard that one before, too. I
remind you of someone you used to be
madly in love with, but she ditched
you for another guy, and you've been
carrying the torch ever since, and
then you saw me and something clicked.

649
01:60:23,166 --> 01:60:23,458
JUDY(scornfully): Huh!

650
01:60:23,458 --> 01:60:24,625
SCOTTIE(With a rueful smile): You're not far wrong.

651
01:60:24,625 --> 01:60:27,625
JUDY: Well, it's not going to work. So
you'd better go.

652
01:60:27,625 --> 01:60:28,791
SCOTTIE: Let me come in.

653
01:60:30,791 --> 01:60:34,666
SCOTTIE: You can leave the door open. Please.
I want to talk to you.

654
01:60:36,666 --> 01:60:39,041
JUDY: I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.

655
01:60:39,041 --> 01:60:40,208
SCOTTIE: You won't have to.

656
01:60:40,208 --> 01:60:43,208
JUDY(Doubtfully): Well... you don't look very much
like Jack the Ripper...

657
01:60:46,208 --> 01:60:48,000
JUDY: What do you want to know?

658
01:60:48,000 --> 01:60:49,166
SCOTTIE: Your name. And --

659
01:60:49,166 --> 01:60:49,750
JUDY: Judy Barton.

660
01:60:49,750 --> 01:60:50,916
SCOTTIE: Who you are --

661
01:60:50,916 --> 01:60:53,291
JUDY: Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --

662
01:60:53,291 --> 01:60:55,958
SCOTTIE: -- and how you happen to be living
here.

663
01:60:55,958 --> 01:60:58,041
JUDY: It's a place to live, that's all.

664
01:60:58,041 --> 01:60:59,833
SCOTTIE: But you haven't lived here long.

665
01:60:59,833 --> 01:61:00,708
JUDY: About three years.

666
01:61:00,708 --> 01:61:04,000
SCOTTIE: No, a year ago! Where did you live a
year ago!!?

667
01:61:04,000 --> 01:61:05,500
JUDY(Puzzled): I told you! Right here!

668
01:61:05,500 --> 01:61:07,583
SCOTTIE(Strongly): But before! Where did you live
before!?!

669
01:61:07,583 --> 01:61:08,166
JUDY: Salina, Kansas!

670
01:61:10,166 --> 01:61:12,541
JUDY: Listen, what is this? What do you
want?

671
01:61:12,541 --> 01:61:14,625
SCOTTIE: I want to know who you are.

672
01:61:14,625 --> 01:61:23,000
JUDY: I told you! My name is Judy Barton!
I come from Salina Kansas. I work at
Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I
have to prove it?

673
01:61:25,000 --> 01:61:32,166
JUDY: You've got to prove you're alive
these days! All right, Mister. My
Kansas driver's license. Judy Barton.
Number Z296794. Four-Twenty-Five
Maple Avenue, Salina, Kansas.

674
01:61:35,166 --> 01:61:42,041
JUDY: There! See the address on this one?
This place here! California License
issued May 25, 1954! Want to check
my thumb print? Satisfied.

675
01:61:42,041 --> 01:61:45,333
JUDY(Pulls the card away): And whether you're satisfied or not,
you can just beat it!

676
01:61:48,333 --> 01:61:52,500
JUDY(Gently): Gee, you have got it bad, haven't
you?  Do I really look like her?

677
01:61:54,500 --> 01:61:55,666
JUDY: She's dead, isn't she.

678
01:61:57,666 --> 01:62:00,333
JUDY: I'm sorry. And I'm sorry I yelled at
you.

679
01:62:05,333 --> 01:62:07,125
JUDY: Yes, that's me. With my mother.

680
01:62:12,125 --> 01:62:16,625
JUDY: That's my father. He's dead. My mother
got married again... I didn't like
the guy.

681
01:62:16,625 --> 01:62:20,208
JUDY(Smiles, wistfully): So... I decided to see what it was
like in sunny California.

682
01:62:20,208 --> 01:62:21,708
JUDY(Smiles, wistfully)(Pause): I've been here three years.

683
01:62:21,708 --> 01:62:22,000
JUDY(Smiles, wistfully)(Pause)(she grins): Honest!

684
01:62:24,000 --> 01:62:25,791
SCOTTIE: Will you have dinner with me?

685
01:62:25,791 --> 01:62:26,958
JUDY(Immediately wary,: the smile fading)
Why?

686
01:62:26,958 --> 01:62:29,958
SCOTTIE: Well, I feel I owe you something for
all this...

687
01:62:29,958 --> 01:62:31,750
JUDY: No, you don't owe me anything.

688
01:62:31,750 --> 01:62:33,250
SCOTTIE: Then will you for me?

689
01:62:33,250 --> 01:62:34,416
JUDY(Warily): Dinner... and what else?

690
01:62:34,416 --> 01:62:35,000
SCOTTIE: Just dinner.

691
01:62:35,000 --> 01:62:36,791
JUDY: Because I remind you of her?

692
01:62:36,791 --> 01:62:39,166
SCOTTIE: Because I'd like to have dinner with
you.

693
01:62:41,166 --> 01:62:46,541
JUDY(Slowly): Well... I've been on blind dates
before... Matter of fact, to be
honest, I've been picked up before.

694
01:62:46,541 --> 01:62:46,833
JUDY(Slowly)(Grins): Okay.

695
01:62:46,833 --> 01:62:50,125
SCOTTIE: I'll get my car and be back in half
an hour.

696
01:62:50,125 --> 01:62:53,416
JUDY: Oh, no! Give me time to change and
get fixed up!

697
01:62:53,416 --> 01:62:54,000
SCOTTIE: An hour?

698
01:62:54,000 --> 01:62:54,291
JUDY: Mmm.

699
01:62:54,291 --> 01:62:54,583
SCOTTIE: Okay.

700
01:63:24,583 --> 01:63:39,583
JUDY'S VOICE: Dearest Scottie ... and so you've
found me. This is the moment I dreaded
and hoped for, -- wondering what I
would say and do if ever I saw you
again, I wanted so to see you again.
Just once. Now I'll go and you can
give up your search.

701
01:63:39,583 --> 01:64:14,958
JUDY'S VOICE(pause): I want you to have peace of mind.
You've nothing to blame yourself
for.  You were the victim. I was the
tool, you were the victim of a man's
plan to murder his wife. He chose me
to play the part because I looked
like her; he dressed me up like her.
He was quite safe because she lived
in the country and rarely came to
town. He chose you to be the witness.
The Carlotta story was part real,
part invented to make you testify
that Madeleine wanted to kill herself.
He knew of your illness; he knew you
would never get up the stairs of the
tower. He planned it so well; he
made no mistakes.

702
01:64:14,958 --> 01:64:35,333
JUDY'S VOICE(pause)(pause): I made the mistake. I fell in love.
That wasn't part of the plan. I'm
still in love with you, and I want
you so to love me. If I had the nerve,
I would stay and lie, hoping that I
could make you love me again, as I
am for myself... and so forget the
other and forget the past. But I
haven't the nerve to try...

703
01:65:11,333 --> 01:65:12,500
JUDY: Thank you again. Good-night.

704
01:65:12,500 --> 01:65:14,000
SCOTTIE: Can I see you tomorrow?

705
01:65:14,000 --> 01:65:15,166
JUDY: Tomorrow night? Well --

706
01:65:15,166 --> 01:65:15,750
SCOTTIE: Tomorrow morning.

707
01:65:15,750 --> 01:65:19,916
JUDY: Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to
work. I've got a job.

708
01:65:19,916 --> 01:65:20,500
SCOTTIE: Don't go.

709
01:65:20,500 --> 01:65:23,791
JUDY(Smiling): And what will I live on? My oil wells
in Texas?

710
01:65:23,791 --> 01:65:25,291
SCOTTIE: I'll take care of you.

711
01:65:25,291 --> 01:65:27,666
JUDY(Flatly): Oh, Well, thank very much. But no
thanks.

712
01:65:27,666 --> 01:65:29,166
SCOTTIE: No, Judy, you don't understand.

713
01:65:29,166 --> 01:65:38,750
JUDY: Oh, I understand, all right. I've
been understanding since I was
seventeen. And the next step is, as
long as you're going to see me
tomorrow, why don't you stay the
night.

714
01:65:38,750 --> 01:65:39,041
SCOTTIE: No.

715
01:65:39,041 --> 01:65:39,916
JUDY: No? Then what?

716
01:65:39,916 --> 01:65:43,208
SCOTTIE: I just want to see you as much as I
can!

717
01:65:43,208 --> 01:65:48,583
JUDY: As friends? We'd just see a lot of
each other as friends, and you'd
"take care of me"?

718
01:65:48,583 --> 01:65:48,875
SCOTTIE: Yes.

719
01:65:48,875 --> 01:65:49,166
JUDY: Why?

720
01:65:49,166 --> 01:65:50,958
JUDY(No answer): Because I remind you of someone?

721
01:65:50,958 --> 01:65:52,125
JUDY(No answer)(No answer): That's not very complimentary.

722
01:65:52,125 --> 01:65:53,291
JUDY(No answer)(No answer)(Pause): And nothing would... happen...

723
01:65:53,291 --> 01:65:53,583
SCOTTIE: No.

724
01:65:53,583 --> 01:65:55,083
JUDY: That's not very complimentary, either.

725
01:65:59,083 --> 01:66:00,875
JUDY(Frightened): Listen, what'd you do that for?!?!

726
01:66:02,875 --> 01:66:06,458
SCOTTIE(Quickly): No, Judy, I'm not going to move!
Please! Stay in the chair!

727
01:66:06,458 --> 01:66:06,750
JUDY: Why?!

728
01:66:06,750 --> 01:66:08,541
SCOTTIE: Please! And don't look at me.

729
01:66:11,541 --> 01:66:12,416
SCOTTIE(Softly): Will you, Judy?

730
01:66:12,416 --> 01:66:16,583
JUDY(Slowly, anxiously): I suppose I could phone the store in
the morning, and say I'm sick.

731
01:66:18,583 --> 01:66:19,458
SCOTTIE(Gently): Good night, Judy.

732
01:66:52,458 --> 01:66:53,625
JUDY: I like that one.

733
01:66:53,625 --> 01:66:56,625
SCOTTIE: No, there. There's a good one. Do
you like that?

734
01:66:56,625 --> 01:66:57,208
JUDY: Yes --

735
01:66:59,208 --> 01:67:00,375
SCOTTIE: We'll take that one.

736
01:67:00,375 --> 01:67:03,041
VENDOR: Very nice. And fresh. I just made it
up.

737
01:67:05,041 --> 01:67:07,416
VENDOR: That'll be a dollar four.  Scottie
pays him

738
01:67:07,416 --> 01:67:08,000
JUDY: It's beautiful.

739
01:67:08,000 --> 01:67:10,666
SCOTTIE: Okay. Now we're going to buy you
some clothes.

740
01:67:10,666 --> 01:67:10,958
JUDY: Honest?

741
01:67:12,958 --> 01:67:15,333
SCOTTIE: There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the
best. Come on.

742
01:67:15,333 --> 01:67:17,125
JUDY(Happy and breathless): But Scottie, you don't have to!

743
01:67:17,125 --> 01:67:18,625
SCOTTIE: I want to! Come on!

744
01:67:30,625 --> 01:67:32,708
SCOTTIE: No, that's not it. Nothing like it.

745
01:67:32,708 --> 01:67:34,208
SALESWOMAN: But you said grey, sir.

746
01:67:34,208 --> 01:67:38,083
SCOTTIE: Not tweed -- it's a smoother material,
with a larger collar and belted.

747
01:67:40,083 --> 01:67:41,875
JUDY: But I like that one, Scottie.

748
01:67:41,875 --> 01:67:43,041
SCOTTIE: No, it's not right.

749
01:67:43,041 --> 01:67:45,416
SALESWOMAN(Cheerfully): The gentleman seems to know what he
wants.

750
01:67:45,416 --> 01:67:47,208
SALESWOMAN(Cheerfully)(To the model): All right. Well, we'll find it.

751
01:67:49,208 --> 01:67:50,708
JUDY(Slightly apprehensive): Scottie, what are you doing?

752
01:67:50,708 --> 01:67:52,791
SCOTTIE: I'm trying to buy you a suit.

753
01:67:52,791 --> 01:67:56,375
JUDY: But I loved the second one she wore.
And this one --

754
01:67:56,375 --> 01:67:58,166
JUDY(She touches a suit: on the chair)
-- is beautiful.

755
01:67:58,166 --> 01:67:59,666
SCOTTIE: They're none of them right.

756
01:67:59,666 --> 01:68:00,250
JUDY: But why?

757
01:68:02,250 --> 01:68:10,916
SALESWOMAN: Oh!!  I think I know the suit you
mean!  We had it -- oh, it must be
sometime ago!  Let me go see. We may
still have the model.

758
01:68:13,916 --> 01:68:16,583
JUDY: You're looking for the suit she wore!
For me?!?

759
01:68:18,583 --> 01:68:20,666
JUDY(Repelled): You want me to dress like her?

760
01:68:20,666 --> 01:68:26,666
SCOTTIE: Judy, I just want you to look nice.
And I know what kind of suit would
look well on you.

761
01:68:26,666 --> 01:68:29,958
JUDY: Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed
like someone dead!

762
01:68:29,958 --> 01:68:30,541
SCOTTIE: Judy --

763
01:68:30,541 --> 01:68:36,541
JUDY: It's a horrible idea! Is that what
I'm here for? To make you feel that
you're with someone that's dead?

764
01:68:39,541 --> 01:68:41,333
SALESWOMAN: She'll be out in a moment.

765
01:68:41,333 --> 01:68:43,708
SCOTTIE: Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --

766
01:68:43,708 --> 01:68:45,208
JUDY: No, I won't do it!!

767
01:68:48,208 --> 01:68:48,500
SCOTTIE: Judy!!

768
01:68:54,500 --> 01:69:02,291
SCOTTIE: Judy, it can't make much difference
to you. I just want to see how you'd
look and I know it won't be the same,
but --

769
01:69:02,291 --> 01:69:07,375
JUDY: No, I don't want any clothes! I don't
want anything! I want to get out of
here!

770
01:69:07,375 --> 01:69:10,041
SCOTTIE(strongly): Judy, you've got to do this for me!
Please!

771
01:69:12,041 --> 01:69:12,916
SCOTTIE: Yes! That's it!

772
01:69:12,916 --> 01:69:13,791
SALESWOMAN: I thought so!

773
01:69:13,791 --> 01:69:14,958
JUDY: I don't like it!

774
01:69:14,958 --> 01:69:16,750
SCOTTIE: We'll take it! Will it fit?

775
01:69:16,750 --> 01:69:20,625
SALESWOMAN: Oh, yes! It may need some slight
alterations, but it is madam's size.

776
01:69:20,625 --> 01:69:21,500
SALESWOMAN(To the model): All right, dear.

777
01:69:21,500 --> 01:69:24,500
SALESWOMAN(To the model)(To Judy): We'll have it for you to try in a
moment.

778
01:69:24,500 --> 01:69:26,291
SCOTTIE: How soon can it be altered?

779
01:69:26,291 --> 01:69:26,583
SALESWOMAN: Well...

780
01:69:26,583 --> 01:69:28,375
SCOTTIE: Can we have it by tonight?

781
01:69:28,375 --> 01:69:29,875
SALESWOMAN: Well, if it's absolutely necessary...

782
01:69:29,875 --> 01:69:37,958
SCOTTIE: Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at
an evening dress, a dinner dress,
black -- short -- long sleeves --
with a neck cut this...

783
01:69:37,958 --> 01:69:39,458
SCOTTIE(Indicates square: neck)
...and the skirt out.

784
01:69:39,458 --> 01:69:40,333
SCOTTIE(Indicates square(Indicates full skirt: with his hands)

785
01:69:40,333 --> 01:69:40,916
JUDY(Appealing): Scottie --

786
01:69:42,916 --> 01:69:47,083
SALESWOMAN(Laughs, embarrassed): My, you certainly do know what you
want, sir. I'll see what we have.

787
01:69:55,083 --> 01:69:55,958
SCOTTIE'S VOICE: All right. Walk.

788
01:69:59,958 --> 01:70:02,958
SCOTTIE: All right. That's it. Do you have in
black, too?

789
01:70:02,958 --> 01:70:03,833
SALESMAN: Yes, we have.

790
01:70:03,833 --> 01:70:04,416
SCOTTIE: All right.

791
01:70:14,416 --> 01:70:16,791
SCOTTIE: Here, Judy. Take it straight down.
It's medicine.

792
01:70:18,791 --> 01:70:21,791
JUDY(Pleading): Why are you doing this? What good
will it do?

793
01:70:23,791 --> 01:70:27,083
SCOTTIE: I don't know. No good, I guess. But
I don't know.

794
01:70:29,083 --> 01:70:32,375
JUDY(Tearfully): I wish you'd leave me alone. I want
to go away.

795
01:70:32,375 --> 01:70:32,958
SCOTTIE: You can.

796
01:70:32,958 --> 01:70:34,458
JUDY: No, you wouldn't let me.

797
01:70:34,458 --> 01:70:36,541
JUDY(Then, almost to: herself)
And I don't want to go...

798
01:70:38,541 --> 01:70:44,541
SCOTTIE: Judy, I want to tell you: these few
days have been the first happy days
I've had in a year.

799
01:70:44,541 --> 01:70:49,916
JUDY(Sadly): I know. Because I remind you of her.
The one that's dead. And not even
that, very much.

800
01:70:49,916 --> 01:70:52,291
SCOTTIE(Meaning it): No, it's you too, Judy. Something in
you.

801
01:70:55,291 --> 01:70:57,375
JUDY(Dully): You don't even want to touch me.

802
01:70:57,375 --> 01:70:58,541
SCOTTIE(Grimly): Yes. Yes, I do.

803
01:71:01,541 --> 01:71:14,416
JUDY: Couldn't you like me, just me, the
way I am?! When we first started out
it was so good! We had fun! And you
started on the clothes! I'll wear
the darned clothes if you want me
to! If you just like me!

804
01:71:17,416 --> 01:71:18,916
SCOTTIE(Studying): The color of your hair...

805
01:71:18,916 --> 01:71:19,500
JUDY: Ah, no!

806
01:71:19,500 --> 01:71:21,583
SCOTTIE: Judy, please it can't matter to you...

807
01:71:23,583 --> 01:71:36,166
JUDY: The trouble is, I'm gone now. For
you. And I can't do anything about
it. I want you to love me. If I let
you change me, will that do it? If I
do what you tell me, will you love
me?

808
01:71:36,166 --> 01:71:36,458
SCOTTIE: Yes.

809
01:71:36,458 --> 01:71:42,458
JUDY: All right. Then I'll do it. Because
I don't care about me anymore. I
just want you to love me.

810
01:71:44,458 --> 01:71:45,625
SCOTTIE(Gently): I'll take you home.

811
01:71:51,625 --> 01:71:59,708
OPERATOR: I'm afraid it's going to be several
hours. The young lady thought perhaps
you'd like to go home, and she'll
come there as soon as she's finished.

812
01:71:59,708 --> 01:72:04,208
SCOTTIE: Oh!  Well... no. Tell her I'll go to
her hotel, and wait for her there.

813
01:72:07,208 --> 01:72:09,875
SCOTTIE: Oh! You're sure about the color of
the hair.

814
01:72:09,875 --> 01:72:11,666
OPERATOR: 0h, yes. It's an easy color.

815
01:72:11,666 --> 01:72:13,166
SCOTTIE: And the rest of --

816
01:72:15,166 --> 01:72:17,250
OPERATOR: Yes, sir. We know what you want.

817
01:72:17,250 --> 01:72:18,125
SCOTTIE: All right. Thanks.

818
01:72:57,125 --> 01:72:57,416
JUDY: Well?

819
01:72:57,416 --> 01:73:03,416
SCOTTIE: It should be back from your face --
with a bun at the neck. I told them.
I told you.

820
01:73:03,416 --> 01:73:05,500
JUDY: We tried it. It didn't suit me.

821
01:73:11,500 --> 01:73:12,083
SCOTTIE: I'm sorry.

822
01:73:14,083 --> 01:73:15,250
SCOTTIE: Judy -- please --

823
01:73:54,250 --> 01:73:56,041
JUDY: Where shall we go for dinner?

824
01:73:56,041 --> 01:73:56,916
SCOTTIE: Wherever you'd like...

825
01:73:56,916 --> 01:73:57,208
JUDY: Ernie's?

826
01:73:57,208 --> 01:73:59,583
SCOTTIE: You've got a thing about Ernie's,
haven't you?

827
01:73:59,583 --> 01:74:01,375
JUDY: Well, after all, it's "our place."

828
01:74:05,375 --> 01:74:06,875
JUDY: Hello, my love. Like me?

829
01:74:08,875 --> 01:74:09,166
SCOTTIE: Mmmm.

830
01:74:09,166 --> 01:74:11,250
JUDY: Is that the best you can do?

831
01:74:13,250 --> 01:74:13,833
SCOTTIE: Come here.

832
01:74:13,833 --> 01:74:15,333
JUDY: Oh, no. You'll muss me.

833
01:74:15,333 --> 01:74:17,125
SCOTTIE: That's what I had in mind.

834
01:74:17,125 --> 01:74:19,208
JUDY: Too late. I've got my face on.

835
01:74:21,208 --> 01:74:23,875
JUDY: I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather
go somewhere else?

836
01:74:23,875 --> 01:74:25,041
SCOTTIE: No, Ernie's is fine.

837
01:74:25,041 --> 01:74:29,541
JUDY: I'm going to have one of those big
beautiful steaks.  And... let's see...
to start...

838
01:74:32,541 --> 01:74:34,625
JUDY: Oh! Help me with this, will you?

839
01:74:37,625 --> 01:74:41,500
SCOTTIE: I've got it.  He bends down and bites
the back of her neck.

840
01:74:41,500 --> 01:74:43,291
JUDY: Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!

841
01:74:43,291 --> 01:74:44,458
SCOTTIE: All in good time.

842
01:74:46,458 --> 01:74:46,750
JUDY: Scottie!

843
01:74:46,750 --> 01:74:47,916
SCOTTIE: How does it work?

844
01:74:47,916 --> 01:74:48,791
JUDY: Can't you see?

845
01:74:48,791 --> 01:74:49,666
SCOTTIE: Oh, yeah. There.

846
01:74:56,666 --> 01:75:04,458
JUDY'S VOICE: Thank you, darling. Now I'm just
about ready; I just have to find my
lipstick. Where did I put it? I had
it a minute ago.

847
01:75:04,458 --> 01:75:07,750
JUDY'S VOICE(Her voice fading): Did I leave it in here? Oh, yes,
here it is!

848
01:75:07,750 --> 01:75:08,916
JUDY'S VOICE(Her voice fading)(Her voice fading in): All right, I'm ready.

849
01:75:11,916 --> 01:75:13,708
JUDY: But first... muss me a little.

850
01:75:15,708 --> 01:75:17,791
JUDY: Ah, Scottie... I do have you, now...

851
01:75:20,791 --> 01:75:25,875
SCOTTIE(Softly): How would you like to go somewhere
out of town for dinner?  Drive down
the peninsula, somewhere?

852
01:75:27,875 --> 01:75:29,375
JUDY: All right, if you'd like.

853
01:75:39,375 --> 01:75:40,541
JUDY: We're going awfully far.

854
01:75:40,541 --> 01:75:42,916
SCOTTIE: I feel like driving. Are you terrible
hungry?

855
01:75:42,916 --> 01:75:44,083
JUDY: No, it's all right.

856
01:76:04,083 --> 01:76:05,250
JUDY: Where are you going?

857
01:76:05,250 --> 01:76:06,416
SCOTTIE(wryly): To complete my cure.

858
01:76:08,416 --> 01:76:13,208
SCOTTIE: One final thing I have to do, and
then I'll be rid of the past, forever.

859
01:76:27,208 --> 01:76:28,708
JUDY: Scottie, why are we here?

860
01:76:28,708 --> 01:76:33,791
SCOTTIE: I told you. I have to go back into
the past. Once more. For the last
time.

861
01:76:33,791 --> 01:76:34,958
JUDY: But why? Why here?

862
01:76:34,958 --> 01:76:35,833
SCOTTIE: Madeleine died here.

863
01:76:40,833 --> 01:76:44,125
JUDY: No, I don't want to go. I want to
stay here.

864
01:76:44,125 --> 01:76:45,000
SCOTTIE: I need you.

865
01:76:45,000 --> 01:76:45,291
JUDY: Why?

866
01:76:45,291 --> 01:76:51,875
SCOTTIE: I can't do it alone. I need you, to
be Madeleine for a while. Then, when
it's done, we'll both be free.

867
01:76:53,875 --> 01:76:54,458
JUDY: I'm scared.

868
01:76:54,458 --> 01:76:59,541
SCOTTIE: So am I, But it has to be done. I
have to tell you about Madeleine,
now.

869
01:77:01,541 --> 01:77:01,833
SCOTTIE: There...

870
01:77:03,833 --> 01:77:11,000
SCOTTIE: ...We stood there and I kissed her
for the last time. And she said, "If
lose me, you'll know that I loved
you --

871
01:77:11,000 --> 01:77:11,583
JUDY(Pleading): Scottie --

872
01:77:11,583 --> 01:77:16,083
SCOTTIE(Going right on): -- and wanted to go on loving you."
And I said, "I won't lose you."

873
01:77:16,083 --> 01:77:16,958
SCOTTIE(Going right on)(pause): But I did.

874
01:77:22,958 --> 01:77:25,041
SCOTTIE'S VOICE: She turned and ran... into the
Church...

875
01:77:31,041 --> 01:77:33,708
SCOTTIE: ...And when I followed her, it was
too late...

876
01:77:35,708 --> 01:77:37,791
JUDY(Frightened): I don't want to go in there!

877
01:77:39,791 --> 01:77:40,375
SCOTTIE: ...too late...

878
01:77:45,375 --> 01:77:50,750
SCOTTIE: I couldn't find her. Then I heard
her footsteps on the stairs, she was
running up the tower.

879
01:77:57,750 --> 01:78:04,625
SCOTTIE'S VOICE: She ran up those stairs... and through
the door at the top of the tower,
and locked it behind her. Then she
jumped.

880
01:78:08,625 --> 01:78:10,125
SCOTTIE: And I couldn't follow her.

881
01:78:10,125 --> 01:78:12,791
SCOTTIE(He closes his eyes: in the agony of
remembering)
God knows I tried.

882
01:78:12,791 --> 01:78:18,166
SCOTTIE(He closes his eyes(He glances down): One doesn't often get a second chance.
I want to stop being haunted. You're
my second chances, Judy.

883
01:78:18,166 --> 01:78:19,041
JUDY(A frightened whisper): Take me away...

884
01:78:19,041 --> 01:78:21,708
SCOTTIE: You look like Madeleine, now. Go up
the stairs.

885
01:78:21,708 --> 01:78:22,000
JUDY: No!

886
01:78:22,000 --> 01:78:23,500
SCOTTIE: Go up the stairs, Judy.

887
01:78:23,500 --> 01:78:24,375
SCOTTIE(Pushing her to the: step)
I'll follow.

888
01:78:36,375 --> 01:78:40,250
SCOTTIE(Quietly): This was as far as I could get. But
you went on. Remember?

889
01:78:42,250 --> 01:78:45,541
SCOTTIE: The necklace, Madeleine. That was
the slip. I remembered the necklace.

890
01:78:48,541 --> 01:78:50,333
SCOTTIE: We're going up the tower, Madeleine.

891
01:78:50,333 --> 01:78:51,500
JUDY: No! Let me go!

892
01:78:51,500 --> 01:78:53,000
SCOTTIE: We're going up the tower.

893
01:78:53,000 --> 01:78:54,166
JUDY: You can't. You're afraid!

894
01:78:54,166 --> 01:78:56,250
SCOTTIE: I'm going to. It's my second chance.

895
01:78:58,250 --> 01:78:58,833
JUDY: Scottie, please...!

896
01:78:58,833 --> 01:79:07,208
SCOTTIE: But you knew, that day, that I
wouldn't be able to follow you didn't
you. Who was at the top when you got
there? Elster? With his wife?

897
01:79:07,208 --> 01:79:07,500
JUDY: Yes!

898
01:79:07,500 --> 01:79:16,166
SCOTTIE: And she was the one who died. Not
you.  The real wife.  You were the
copy, you were the counterfeit. Was
she dead or alive when you got there?

899
01:79:16,166 --> 01:79:17,666
JUDY: Dead. He'd broken her neck.

900
01:79:17,666 --> 01:79:26,666
SCOTTIE: Took no chances, did he?  And when
you got there, he pushed her off the
tower, was that it? But you were the
one who screamed. Why did you scream?

901
01:79:26,666 --> 01:79:30,250
JUDY: I wanted to stop it, I ran up to
stop it --

902
01:79:30,250 --> 01:79:48,833
SCOTTIE: Why? Since you'd tricked me so well
up to then?!! You played his wife so
well, Judy! He made you over, didn't
he? Just as I've done. But better!
Not just the hair and the clothes!
the look! the manner! the words!
Those beautiful phony trances! That
jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're
really a strong swimmer, aren't you!
Aren't you!!

903
01:79:50,833 --> 01:79:55,333
SCOTTIE: Did he train you? Rehearse you?
Teach you what to say and what to
do?

904
01:79:55,333 --> 01:79:55,625
JUDY: Yes!

905
01:79:55,625 --> 01:80:03,416
SCOTTIE: And you were such an apt pupil! What
fun you two must have had, playing
games with me! Why me? Why did he
pick on me?!!

906
01:80:03,416 --> 01:80:04,000
JUDY: Your accident...

907
01:80:04,000 --> 01:80:08,500
SCOTTIE: Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the
made-to-order witness. Where is he
now?

908
01:80:08,500 --> 01:80:09,666
JUDY: I don't know... Switzerland?

909
01:80:09,666 --> 01:80:10,541
SCOTTIE: We'll find him.

910
01:80:12,541 --> 01:80:13,416
SCOTTIE: I made it.

911
01:80:13,416 --> 01:80:15,208
JUDY(Apprehensive): What are you going to do?

912
01:80:15,208 --> 01:80:18,208
SCOTTIE: Look at the scene of the crime. Go
on in.

913
01:80:21,208 --> 01:80:21,791
SCOTTIE: Go on!

914
01:80:28,791 --> 01:80:34,458
SCOTTIE: You both hid behind there, mmm?...
'til everything was clear... then
sneaked down and drove back to the
city.

915
01:80:34,458 --> 01:80:37,458
SCOTTIE(Glances at her): And then? You were his girl. What
happened to you?

916
01:80:39,458 --> 01:80:40,625
SCOTTIE: Did he ditch you?

917
01:80:43,625 --> 01:80:53,791
SCOTTIE: Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money,
and the freedom and the power...  he
ditched you? What a shame! But he
knew he was safe. You couldn't talk.
Didn't he give you anything?

918
01:80:53,791 --> 01:80:54,375
JUDY(Faintly): Some money.

919
01:80:54,375 --> 01:81:01,250
SCOTTIE: And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace.
That was your mistake, Judy. One
shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing.
You shouldn't have been that
sentimental.

920
01:81:03,250 --> 01:81:05,041
JUDY(Apprehensive): What are you going to do?

921
01:81:05,041 --> 01:81:06,208
SCOTTIE: I loved you, Madeleine.

922
01:81:06,208 --> 01:81:19,375
JUDY(Desperately): I was safe when you found me, there
was nothing you could prove! But
when I saw you again I couldn't run
away, I loved you so! I walked into
danger and let you change me again
because I loved you and wanted you!

923
01:81:19,375 --> 01:81:23,541
JUDY(Desperately)(She throws herself: into his arms)
Scottie, please! You love me now!
Love me! Keep me safe!

924
01:81:26,541 --> 01:81:28,041
JUDY(softly, pleading): Love me... keep me safe...

925
01:81:28,041 --> 01:81:30,708
SCOTTIE(Whispering): Too late... too late... there's no
bringing her back.

926
01:81:42,708 --> 01:81:43,291
JUDY(Whispering): No... no...

927
01:81:50,291 --> 01:81:51,166
THE NUN(Simply): I heard voices...

928
01:81:58,166 --> 01:81:59,041
THE NUN: God have mercy...

929
01:82:10,041 --> 01:82:31,916
