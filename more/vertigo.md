EXT.
SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK)
 - CLOSE SHOT
We see a close view of a roof parapet and the curved rail of a fire escape.
In the bag, are large skyscrapers with all their windows fully lit in the late winter afternoon.
This background is used for the CREDIT TITLES of the picture.  After the last card has FADED OUT, we HOLD on to the empty parapet, when suddenly a man's hand reaches and grips the top of the rail.
It is followed by another hand and, after a beat, we see the face of a man in his early 30's.
He is an Italian type, with rough features.
He turns quickly and looks below him and then turning back, springs up over the empty parapet and is lost from view.
We STAY on the EMPTY SCENE for a second or two as we HEAR the scraping of boots on the iron ladder.
Someone else is coming up.
Presently, two more hands and the head of a uniformed policeman with cap and badge starts to climb over the parapet.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK so that by the time he has completed his climb, he is in full figure.
He dashes out of the picture drawing his gun.  Immediately following him over the parapet, a detective in plain clothes climbs over.
This is JOHN FERGUSON, known as SCOTTIE.
He too pulls a gun and dashes out of the picture.
EXT.
SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK)
 - LONG SHOT
A vast panorama of the San Francisco skyline.
Nearer to us are three tiny figures running and jumping over the roof tops.
The man on the run, whom we first saw climb over the parapet, is dressed in a white shirt and light tan linen slacks, and wearing sneakers.
The uniformed man is shooting at him.
Scottie is dressed in medium grey clothes.
The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS the group across the roof tops.
EXT.
SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK)
 - MED.
SHOT
We now see a short gap between rooftops, with a drop below.  The pursued man makes the leap successfully followed by the uniformed policeman.
Scottie makes the same leap, but almost trips in taking off and is thrown off balance.
He tries to recover, lands awkwardly on the opposite roof, and falls forward, prone, with a heavy impact that hurts and drives tile breath from his body.
He tries to rise but raises his head with a look of pain -- one leg is doubled up under the other.
The tiles give way, and he slides backwards, and his legs go over the edge of the roof, then his body.
In his daze he grasps at the loose tiles, and as he goes over the edge he clutches on to the gutter, which gives way, and he swings off into space, looking down.

From Scottie's viewpoint, the gap beneath the building and the ground below.
It seems to treble its depth.

Scottie looking down with horror.
His eyes close as a wave of nausea overcomes him.

In the distance the fleeing criminal.
The policeman, seeing what has happened to Scottie, returns to the slope of the roof and strains to reach down to Scottie. 
POLICEMAN:
Give me your hand!
EXT.
SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK)
 - CLOSE UP
SCOTTIE'S HEAD.
His hands grip the edge of the guttering.  The tips of the fingers of policeman straining to reach Scottie, are at the top of screen.
Scottie begins to open his grip but stares down, he quickly resumes his grip looking up hopelessly towards the helping hand.
He looks down again.  FROM SCOTTIE'S VIEWPOINT - the ground below still a long way away.

The policeman's hand in foreground, his face beyond. 
POLICEMAN:
What's the matter with you?
Give me your hand!
Policeman endeavors to stretch out his hand further.
EXT.
SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK)

The tiles beneath the policeman's heel begin to give.
The Policeman starts to slide.
He claws desperately at the surface of the roof.

Scottie, his eyes closed.
He opens them as he hears a wild cry.

EXT.
SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK)
 - LONG SHOT
The body of the policeman sprawled on the ground below.  People are running into the alleyway; they stare at the body, look up to where Scottie is hanging.
We see the light on their upturned faces.
And now we hear a police whistle blown shrilly, again and again.  Up to this moment the background music has had an excitement to match the scene, and now it cuts off, abruptly, leaving on the echo of the police whistle as the DISSOLVE begins.
Then, in the DISSOLVE, we hear the gentle insistence of Scarlatti played by a chamber orchestra.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT.
AN APARTMENT ON RUSSIAN HILL - (LATE AFTERNOON)

It is fresh, light, and simple, and crowded with books, phonograph records, pictures.
The most striking feature of the apartment is the view: The rising hills of San Francisco framed by a large picture window.
To one side of the window is the owner of the apartment, MAJORIE WOOD, called MIDGE, at a commercial drawing table concentrating with professional intensity on a drawing of a slim, a elongated woman with few features and fewer clothes.
A brassiere sits on a table at Midge's elbow, and she studies it as she draws.
Midge Wood is about thirty-seven, attractive, straight-forward, well-but-simply-dressed; she wears glasses but does not whip them an and off as they do in the movies.
The music comes from a gramophone.
The other occupant of the room is Scottie.
He sits in a big chair, with his feet stretched out on an ottoman and his head far back.
There is a drink on a table nearby.
He rouses himself to reach for it, and in doing so knocks over his walking stick that has been propped against the chair.
He reaches out to catch it, and in the quickness of trying to keep it from falling, he wrenches his body around. 
SCOTTIE:
Ow!!

MIDGE:
(Paying little attention)
I thought you said no more aches and pains?

SCOTTIE:
It's this darned corset.
It binds.  
He retrieves the stick. 
MIDGE:
No three-way stretch?
How very un- chic. 
SCOTTIE:
Well, you know those police department doctors: 
no sense of style.                        
(Sighs gratefully)
Ah, tomorrow!

MIDGE:
What's tomorrow?

SCOTTIE:
Tomorrow...
the corset comes off.  And this thing goes out the window.                        (He waves the stick)
I shall be a free man.
I shall wiggle my behind...
free and unconfined.
He raises his eyebrows with a surprised and gratified smile.  Midge looks over at him with a grimace. 
SCOTTIE:
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?

MIDGE:
More than you think. 
SCOTTIE:
(Interested)

How do you know?
Personal experience?

MIDGE:
Please!(Then, impersonally)

And what happens after tomorrow?

SCOTTIE:
What do you mean?

MIDGE:
What are you going to do?
Now that you've quit the police force?

SCOTTIE:
(Gently)
You sound so disapproving, Midge. 
MIDGE:
No, it's your life.
But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day. 
SCOTTIE:
(Gently)
I had to quit, Midge. 
MIDGE:
Why?

SCOTTIE:
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof...
and try to reach out for him. 
MIDGE:
It wasn't your fault. 
SCOTTIE:
I know.
Everybody tells me. 
MIDGE:
Johnny, the doctors explained --

SCOTTIE:
I know.
I have Acrophobia.
What a disease.
A fear of heights.
														   
	
And what a moment to find out I had it. 
MIDGE:
Well, you've got it.
And there's no losing it.
And there's no one to blame.
So why quit?

SCOTTIE:
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?

MIDGE:
It's where you belong. 
SCOTTIE:
(With a grin)
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge.
If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!

MIDGE:
(Laughs)
Ah, Johnny-O...
She considers him for a moment, then goes back to her work.  By now he is up and wandering about with the help of the stick. 
MIDGE:
(Finally, as she works)
Well?...
what'll you do?

SCOTTIE:
Nothing for a while.
You forget, I'm a man of independent means.
Or fairly independent. 
MIDGE:
Mmm.
Why don't you go away for a while?

SCOTTIE:
(Grins)
To forget?
Don't be so motherly, Midge.
I'm not going to crack up. 
MIDGE:
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?

SCOTTIE:
I'm having one now.
She looks up sharply with quick apprehension. 
SCOTTIE:
From that music. 
MIDGE:
Oh!
She goes and turns off the gramophone.
Scottie has wandered over to the drawing table. 
SCOTTIE:
What's this do-hickey here?
He turns the brassiere over with his stick

MIDGE:
It's a brassiere.
You know about those things.
You're a big boy, now. 
SCOTTIE:
I've never run across one like that. 
MIDGE:
It's brand new.
Revolutionary uplift.  No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do.
																			 
It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge. 
SCOTTIE:
(Impressed)
Uh-huh!

MIDGE:
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it.
He worked it out in his spare time. 
SCOTTIE:
What a pleasant hobby.
He wanders back to the chair and watches her work for a long moment.
Then:

SCOTTIE:
How's your love life, Midge?

MIDGE:
That's following a train of thought. 
SCOTTIE:
Well?

MIDGE:
Normal. 
SCOTTIE:
Aren't you ever going to get married?

MIDGE:
(Lightly)
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O. 
SCOTTIE:
Yeah, I'm a brute.
We were engaged once though, weren't we?

MIDGE:
Three whole weeks. 
SCOTTIE:
Ah, sweet college days.
But you're the one who blew it.
I'm still available.
Available Ferguson.
Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?

MIDGE:
Gavin?
Gavin Elster?
				
You'd think I'd would.
No. 
SCOTTIE:
I got a call from him today.
Funny.  He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East.
						   
I guess he's back.                        (he fishes out a slip of paper)
It's a Mission number. 
MIDGE:
That's Skid Row...
isn't it?

SCOTTIE:
Could be. 
MIDGE:
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink. 
SCOTTIE:
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles.
													  
But not tonight.
If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight.                        (He rises to go)


MIDGE:
Sorry, old man.
Work. 
SCOTTIE:
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?

MIDGE:
What. 
SCOTTIE:
My...
the acrophobia. 
MIDGE:
I asked my doctor.
He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't.
And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out. 
SCOTTIE:
I think I can lick it. 
MIDGE:
How?

SCOTTIE:
I've got a theory.
Look.
If I can get used to heights just a little at a time...
progressively see?
He has been looking about eagerly, sees a low footstool, drags it to the center of the room as he speaks. 
SCOTTIE:
Here, I'll show you what I mean.  We'll start with this. 
MIDGE:
That!?!

SCOTTIE:
What do you want me to start with --the Golden Gate Bridge?
He has stepped up on the footstool and stands there proudly looking up and down. 
SCOTTIE:
Now.

Wait a minute.
She dashes to the kitchen, returns quickly with a small aluminum household ladder. 
SCOTTIE:

Okay.
He gets up on the second step and goes through the routine. 
SCOTTIE:
I look up, I look down.
I look up, I look down.
I'm going to go right out and buy me a nice, tall stepladder.
Here we go.
He gets on the top step. 
MIDGE:
Easy, now. 
SCOTTIE:
This is a cinch.
I look up, I look down.
I look up --
And at this moment he makes the mistake of turning and looking out through the picture window.
FROM SCOTTIE'S VIEWPOINT
We see the depth down to the street below the window.
The whole picture begins to weave.
INT.
MIDGE'S APARTMENT - (LATE AFTERNOON)
 - CLOSEUP
of Scottie -- expression of nausea.
FROM SCOTTIE'S VIEW POINT - LONG SHOT
The weaving view changes to the original scene where the ground receded in a rush and the body of the policeman fell into space.
INT.
MIDGE'S APARTMENT - (LATE AFTERNOON)
 - MEDIUM CLOSE
SHOT
Scottie's face distorted with agony -- his eyes close and he begins to slump.
CAMERA PULLS BACK SLIGHTLY as Midge now comes into shot, putting up her hands to him to hold him, and his weight is on her and his head is slumped, and the joke is over. 
MIDGE:
		   
			 
   
				
			  
	
	 
												 
   
Johnny!

SCOTTIE:
(Muttering, his face tight, his eyes shut)
Oh, damn it!
