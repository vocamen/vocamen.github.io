This is the first version (2018) of the storyboard of the introduction of our current movie:
It has very few images and audio is in French :)

This one is at blocking stage but the final audio is not recorded yet (voices are [welcome](engage/)!)

## Stages
Animation movies are built following different stages, here are the main ones:
- idea
- concept art
- gathering related inspirational art
- writing
- scripting
- drawing scenes
- storyboarding
- audio recording
- storyboard, validation
- characters and props sculpting
- scene creations
- blocking, validation
- body rigging
- animation shooting
- animations
- lip syncing
- final, validation
- compositing
- rendering
- post processing

Do you ever wonder how much and why a script was changed after it was written?
Would you like to write better stories that stick to human behavior?
That's why we developed a professional tool analyzing movie documents to [reproduce steps from script to final movie](movies/).
