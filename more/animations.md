![2D frame by frame dance](../../img/granny.gif)

This simple 2D animation of a dynamic (and exhausting!) granny lasts 8 seconds.

For these 8sec animation, you will need:
- skills
- 202 drawings or other mean to express the animation
- approximately 8 hours of editing (cleaning, aligning, looping)

This is why 2D animation movies require resources.
We made it to show our skills and break down details.

We'd love your [support](https://patreon.com/vocamen), to help us make Christian movies.
Every cent counts.
