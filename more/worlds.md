### C.S Lewis explained why we need to cater worlds to occupy the line of communication
> We can make people (often) attend to the Christian point of view for half an hour or so;
> but the moment they have gone away from our lecture or laid down our article, they are 
> plunged back into a world where the opposite position is taken for granted. 
> As long as that situation exists, widespread success is simply impossible. 
> We must attack the enemyâ€™s line of communication "
